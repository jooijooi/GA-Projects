    "# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING VADAR (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) (APPLE) \n",
    "\n",
    "Vadar  was constructed using human raters from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We regard it as a reliable lexicon to extract emotional or sentiment polarity\n",
    "\n",
    "We note the limitations of Vadar for this project.Vadar is sensitive to both the polarity and the intensity of sentiments and while some may view it more suited to analyzing social media texts rather than factual headlines which tends to lack emotional intensity, emotions and acronyms, we find it sufficiently applicable to sentiment analysis in our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vadar combines a dictionary of lexical features to valence scores with a set of five heuristics. \n",
    "We left in heuristics like punctuation but removed capitalization as this could inaccurately increase the intensity of positive and negative words which we felt might not be relevant for factual headlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Compound score is a metric that calculates the sum of all the lexicon ratings which have been normalized between -1(most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "positive sentiment : (compound score >= 0.05)\n",
    "neutral sentiment : (compound score > -0.05) and (compound score < 0.05)\n",
    "negative sentiment : (compound score <= -0.05)\n",
