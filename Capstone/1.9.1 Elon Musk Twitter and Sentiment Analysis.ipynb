      "Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pump & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit.\n",
      "So long a air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castle or inflatable maze work. Needs very little power a the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.\n",
      "Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)\n",
      "Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter wa 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 min or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.\n",
      "Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tube for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shape like the 70cm hole.\n",
