2,2020-04-16 09:15:03+00:00,Interesting
3,2020-04-16 09:03:43+00:00,So true
4,2020-04-16 08:37:51+00:00,"Not to mention Medtronic, who makes the most advanced ventilators in the world, also affirming our help! https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1247166543336742912?s=12"
5,2020-04-16 08:20:34+00:00,I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb.

12,2020-04-16 07:57:19+00:00,.@GavinNewsom please fix this misunderstanding
13,2020-04-16 07:55:06+00:00,Exactly
14,2020-04-16 07:54:29+00:00,What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
15,2020-04-16 07:50:51+00:00,“Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.
16,2020-04-16 07:44:36+00:00,“Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo
17,2020-04-16 06:01:24+00:00,"A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation & you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable."
18,2020-04-16 05:48:55+00:00,Sounds about right
19,2020-04-16 04:51:04+00:00,Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
20,2020-04-16 04:43:38+00:00,"I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington"
21,2020-04-16 04:38:49+00:00,We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights & stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
22,2020-04-16 04:22:43+00:00,"They were, but are they currently?"
23,2020-04-16 04:20:46+00:00,Interesting
24,2020-04-16 04:04:26+00:00,"We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty."
25,2020-04-16 03:32:49+00:00,Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
26,2020-04-16 02:51:04+00:00,Sure
27,2020-04-16 02:38:55+00:00,"Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet …"
28,2020-04-16 02:34:29+00:00,"SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator & static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps."
29,2020-04-16 02:30:22+00:00,That’s for sure! 
30,2020-04-16 02:28:45+00:00,I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 
31,2020-04-16 02:24:27+00:00,My (again) personal favorite is
32,2020-04-16 02:18:55+00:00,"Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle."
33,2020-04-16 02:13:33+00:00,"Depends on patient lung strength, but, again just my personal opinion, I wouldn’t go much above their natural lung pressure"
34,2020-04-16 02:10:25+00:00,"Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat & driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2."
35,2020-04-16 02:04:07+00:00,SN26
36,2020-04-16 02:00:00+00:00,"Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!"
37,2020-04-16 01:56:20+00:00,"The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!"
38,2020-04-16 01:54:49+00:00,"Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch"
39,2020-04-16 01:53:33+00:00,"Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage & payload separation system also not US."
40,2020-04-16 01:50:01+00:00,"Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips & Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation & setting PEEP & O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage."
41,2020-04-16 01:37:28+00:00,"Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%."
42,2020-04-16 01:30:48+00:00,"Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!"
43,2020-04-16 01:28:44+00:00,"Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!"
44,2020-04-16 01:22:50+00:00,"Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often & is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing."
45,2020-04-16 01:19:12+00:00,"Also, it costs less $to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test."
46,2020-04-16 01:03:31+00:00,"True. Only reason other medium & heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they’d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying."
47,2020-04-15 00:02:29+00:00,"To be clear, Fremont & Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it’s hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop"
48,2020-04-14 23:59:35+00:00,Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
49,2020-04-14 23:58:39+00:00,You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
50,2020-04-14 23:58:13+00:00,"There’s tough competition for that title, but we will give it our best shot!"
51,2020-04-14 23:56:31+00:00,"Giga Berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature"
52,2020-04-13 18:05:42+00:00,This will happen
53,2020-04-13 08:25:17+00:00,We stole that from cheetahs
54,2020-04-13 08:22:44+00:00,"In case it’s not already obvious, our product plan is basically stolen from Spaceballs"
55,2020-04-13 08:18:14+00:00,"There’s a lot to talk about just on the battery front, so, yeah, just that. I guess we could answer some powertrain questions in Q&A."
56,2020-04-13 08:14:09+00:00,"Just battery day, but it will be great. Plaid powertrain will be later this year."

61,2020-04-12 07:34:23+00:00,Yes
62,2020-04-12 05:38:20+00:00,Functionality still looking good for this year. Regulatory approval is the big unknown.
63,2020-04-12 05:36:36+00:00,"It’s not turned on. Meant for vandalism monitoring in a robotaxi future. Also, the car has transparent windows, so spying has limited value."
64,2020-04-12 05:26:40+00:00,Turns out that gun is for the toilet paper
65,2020-04-12 05:11:24+00:00,Correct
66,2020-04-11 21:24:12+00:00,"Yes, this is a real problem. The science is not in doubt."
67,2020-04-11 14:38:01+00:00,Particulate matter from automotive exhausts has a much more serious impact on health than most people realize
68,2020-04-11 14:06:09+00:00,"In the future, it will be as strange to have expendable rockets as it would be to have expendable airplanes today. All will be reusable."
69,2020-04-11 14:03:06+00:00,The swivel wing design was cool. This seems like a good idea: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikal_(rocket_booster)
70,2020-04-11 13:55:34+00:00,"Strange, as SpaceX lands on land frequently. Russia has very talented engineers, but they must be given reusability as goal or success is impossible."
71,2020-04-11 13:42:04+00:00,A lot has happened in 8 years
72,2020-04-11 07:12:23+00:00,Good talking to you too. It was an honor.
73,2020-04-11 06:45:17+00:00,"SpaceX rockets are 80% reusable, theirs are 0%. This is the actual problem."
74,2020-04-10 23:16:46+00:00, Tragedy
75,2020-04-10 23:11:06+00:00,"Tunnels aren’t required for this, but might be the only realistic way to solve for downtown to downtown travel"

87,2020-04-09 06:19:37+00:00,Hard to predict dates right now. Most likely postponed to mid May.
88,2020-04-09 06:16:46+00:00,In about a year. Would come from Giga Berlin.
89,2020-04-09 06:14:32+00:00,You may return the vehicle for a full refund in the unlikely event that it causes domestic discord

93,2020-04-08 22:18:50+00:00,What is simple in one arena is often profound in another
94,2020-04-08 21:27:07+00:00,Ok
95,2020-04-08 20:56:19+00:00,Great differences in technology exist in the world about which even hardcore technologists are unaware

97,2020-04-08 02:43:31+00:00,Certainly no problem for a 144 trillion operations per second computer to make ~15 steering/acceleration/braking maneuvers per second. That’s a trillion calculations between each output command.
98,2020-04-08 01:18:33+00:00,"Humans drive using 2 cameras on a slow gimbal & are often distracted. A Tesla with 8 cameras, radar, sonar & always being alert can definitely be superhuman."

128,2020-04-05 13:00:39+00:00,True. Each of these engines is also slightly different. Raptor is evolving rapidly.
129,2020-04-05 08:17:56+00:00,"It is stable on the ground without propellant loaded, which is an improvement from OG Atlas"

136,2020-04-05 07:24:50+00:00,"Hard to hide anything from the Internet! Yeah, we’re going to reuse much of the thrust section."
137,2020-04-05 07:23:37+00:00,"Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe."
138,2020-04-05 07:14:16+00:00,"Rockets & spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo."
139,2020-04-05 07:08:43+00:00,There are redundant pressure control valves. It’s a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
140,2020-04-05 07:06:56+00:00,"If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you’re doomed anyway, so might as well go all in"
141,2020-04-05 07:02:27+00:00,We’re adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
142,2020-04-05 05:54:54+00:00,"Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2."

154,2020-04-03 22:48:10+00:00,Some progress
155,2020-04-03 22:47:02+00:00,"Yeah, probably July 1st"
156,2020-04-03 22:43:49+00:00,Hoping to roll out traffic lights & stops to wide US release in a few weeks & probably WW release in Q3 (so many variations in each country!). Very important to make sure this is done right.

168,2020-04-02 22:42:30+00:00,Sounds promising. Will be interesting to see results of clinical trials.
169,2020-04-02 22:24:34+00:00,For those who care about details
170,2020-04-02 22:22:03+00:00,You’re most welcome! Impressive work by Mount Sinai team.
171,2020-04-02 22:18:12+00:00,"SN3 passed ambient temperature pressure test last night, now doing cryogenic"
172,2020-04-02 20:23:14+00:00,Weird that so many troll/bot accounts were activated to attack on this fake issue. Wonder who’s behind it.
173,2020-04-02 20:11:50+00:00,"Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low."
174,2020-04-02 19:51:50+00:00,"Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight."
175,2020-04-02 19:50:03+00:00,"Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed & Philips ventilators before delivery & all confirmed they would be critical."
176,2020-04-02 08:54:06+00:00,Will call when we reach Mars
177,2020-04-02 04:12:18+00:00,Exactly
178,2020-04-01 21:20:07+00:00,Definitely need a wider span
179,2020-04-01 21:15:25+00:00,Yeah
180,2020-04-01 21:12:51+00:00,"Yes, v close! Nice work. Those are V0.9 legs, so major upgrades coming. Need wider span, longer stroke & ability to auto-level for uneven ground or leaning into high winds."
181,2020-04-01 21:01:50+00:00,Interesting
182,2020-04-01 05:08:48+00:00,"Y has next-level upgrades, especially body castings & heat pump"
183,2020-03-31 19:07:54+00:00,Happy we could be helpful! More available if needed.
184,2020-03-31 19:02:42+00:00,"Mass of initial SN ships will be a little high & Isp a little low, but, over time, it will be ~150t to LEO fully reusable"
185,2020-03-31 15:27:02+00:00,"We have extra FDA-approved ventilators. Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device & shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or @Tesla know."
186,2020-03-31 15:11:05+00:00,"The legs extend & telescope out, so are longer than they seem, but not as long as they will be for SN4+"

199,2020-03-28 22:52:02+00:00,"And many doctors are not treating patients, due to fear of giving or receiving C19"
200,2020-03-28 05:14:23+00:00,This sounds great
201,2020-03-28 05:11:27+00:00,Can you do a fast antibody test?
202,2020-03-27 22:54:50+00:00,Yes
203,2020-03-27 22:51:10+00:00,"Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test, so you know if you’re immune. Refill blood banks & give donors peace of mind."

205,2020-03-27 18:56:22+00:00,Also makes for a great shelter
206,2020-03-27 15:55:34+00:00,"We will give away all our ventilators, whether we buy them or build them"
207,2020-03-27 15:42:50+00:00,"Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed."
208,2020-03-27 15:27:10+00:00,"Biggest value Tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the ICU where & when they’re needed. There are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues."
209,2020-03-27 15:13:39+00:00,You’re most welcome. Credit to the Tesla team. Will do our best to help in any way.

216,2020-03-26 20:30:13+00:00,"Working on that with Medtronic. Given NY pressing needs, we’re delivering Resmed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators to NY hospitals starting tonight."
217,2020-03-26 18:54:25+00:00,Sigh

222,2020-03-25 19:46:12+00:00,Giga New York will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible. We will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York.
223,2020-03-25 19:41:51+00:00,Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include “estimated illness onset date”. This is a significantly less rigorous standard.
224,2020-03-25 19:17:31+00:00,C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
225,2020-03-25 18:31:43+00:00,Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
226,2020-03-25 18:28:46+00:00,Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.
227,2020-03-24 18:42:18+00:00,This meme proves it

231,2020-03-24 18:14:14+00:00,Have let @twitter know
232,2020-03-24 18:09:15+00:00,This is messed up @MikeBloomberg

234,2020-03-24 03:30:40+00:00,"Could maybe tap the condensation for water too. Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure, fresh water & just dump it on the ground."
235,2020-03-24 02:41:46+00:00,"Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority & LAX customs for acting so swiftly"
236,2020-03-24 02:37:43+00:00,"Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!"
237,2020-03-24 01:46:53+00:00,"Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car & know when you’re expected home, so temp & humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy."
238,2020-03-24 00:33:16+00:00,This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
239,2020-03-24 00:31:14+00:00,"Sure would love to do home hvac that’s quiet & efficient, with humidity control & HEPA filter"
240,2020-03-24 00:24:30+00:00,Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast & extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me.
241,2020-03-24 00:02:10+00:00,The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond
242,2020-03-23 23:19:19+00:00,Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I’ve seen in a while. Team did next-level work.
243,2020-03-23 23:13:21+00:00, 
244,2020-03-23 22:50:17+00:00,Will do
245,2020-03-23 22:34:32+00:00,"Most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page:"
246,2020-03-23 22:29:31+00:00,Exactly
247,2020-03-23 22:13:41+00:00,"According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries."
248,2020-03-23 21:49:44+00:00,Engineering ftw
249,2020-03-23 20:21:21+00:00,Much appreciated
250,2020-03-23 07:16:20+00:00,Have you seen more data on HCQ & Z-Pak? Hard to find.
251,2020-03-23 07:10:40+00:00,Worrisome
252,2020-03-23 06:56:50+00:00,Yup
253,2020-03-23 02:30:44+00:00,We’ll try to get & deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
254,2020-03-23 01:17:52+00:00,Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.
255,2020-03-23 00:34:05+00:00,Nice
256,2020-03-23 00:02:59+00:00,This is great advice
257,2020-03-23 00:01:40+00:00,Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there’s anything else you need.
258,2020-03-22 23:58:33+00:00,"We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed & operating is the harder part."
259,2020-03-22 23:54:14+00:00,Supply chain logistics — getting masks & other PPE to the right places in time — is the main issue we’re hearing from ER physicians
260,2020-03-22 20:46:48+00:00,You’re most welcome. We’re working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
261,2020-03-22 14:35:45+00:00,Panic is always dumb
262,2020-03-22 14:35:29+00:00,"Italy: “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.”"
263,2020-03-22 14:31:50+00:00,"Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors"
264,2020-03-21 21:19:16+00:00,We have N95 masks & getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
265,2020-03-21 18:22:39+00:00,Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
266,2020-03-21 17:27:47+00:00,No problem :)
267,2020-03-21 17:26:42+00:00,"Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe & should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China."
268,2020-03-21 17:08:26+00:00,"Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world"
269,2020-03-21 16:05:11+00:00,Fair point :)
270,2020-03-21 15:58:19+00:00,"Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too."
271,2020-03-21 15:17:41+00:00,Up to 80% false positive
272,2020-03-21 15:14:41+00:00,"Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases & using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand."
273,2020-03-21 15:09:07+00:00,Do you have data on the false positive rate? I’ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”.
274,2020-03-21 14:56:23+00:00,Important consideration
275,2020-03-20 20:48:40+00:00,Feels like the plot of Deus Ex https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game)
276,2020-03-20 18:06:45+00:00,"A single computer, pump & pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care & avoid cross-flow risk"
277,2020-03-20 17:54:35+00:00,"Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too"
278,2020-03-20 17:39:45+00:00,"That won’t work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory can’t stay open"
279,2020-03-20 17:31:22+00:00,"Yes, we’re working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won’t be needed"

286,2020-03-19 21:55:03+00:00,"Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids & grandparents probably most risky."
287,2020-03-19 21:38:57+00:00,"Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April"
288,2020-03-19 21:37:14+00:00,Yes
289,2020-03-19 21:34:04+00:00,No new domestic corona cases in China

294,2020-03-19 04:37:05+00:00,"Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn’t happened already."
295,2020-03-19 04:16:37+00:00,"Tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems. SpaceX makes spacecraft with life support systems. Ventilators are not difficult, but cannot be produced instantly. Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now?"
296,2020-03-19 03:52:29+00:00,We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
297,2020-03-19 03:48:57+00:00,

336,2020-03-14 22:18:16+00:00,"Some parts will use 304L, as it has higher toughness at cryo temps. Will move to internally developed alloys probably end of year."
337,2020-03-14 22:14:47+00:00,Probably. Raptor sounds different to Merlin.
338,2020-03-14 22:12:25+00:00,Lot of Raptors coming through! Now operating both horizontal & vertical firing stands in McGregor.

395,2020-03-08 07:40:26+00:00,"Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date & over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating & virus will exceed mass of known universe!"

409,2020-03-04 18:18:45+00:00,"True. Oddly, those who complained didn’t actually order FSD. Perhaps they weren’t aware that the computer is upgraded for free if the FSD option is ordered even after delivery."

418,2020-03-03 01:25:08+00:00,This is vital
419,2020-03-03 01:21:14+00:00,Just want say that I support @Jack as Twitter CEO. He has a good .

422,2020-03-02 08:49:34+00:00,"We’re stripping SN2 to bare minimum to test the thrust puck to dome weld under pressure, first with water, then at cryo. Hopefully, ready to test in a few days."
423,2020-03-02 08:40:40+00:00,There’s a puck at the base that takes the engine thrust load. Don’t shuck the puck!

433,2020-02-27 19:45:08+00:00,Testing Raptor in vertical configuration (on the giant tripod) should allow us to simplify some aspects of the engine design
434,2020-02-26 19:25:28+00:00,It’s not mine
435,2020-02-26 18:42:19+00:00,Definitely! What’s in that sky city thing!? Needs a prequel even more than a sequel.
436,2020-02-26 17:20:17+00:00,Sure
437,2020-02-26 16:52:19+00:00,Posting SpaceX videos is definitely not copyright infringement!
438,2020-02-26 07:23:36+00:00,"Hopefully, in March. Checking …"
439,2020-02-26 07:21:49+00:00,I had no idea this existed. Sounds awesome though!
440,2020-02-26 07:09:51+00:00,"Full disclosure, I’m actually a 3000 year old vampire. It’s such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries!"
441,2020-02-26 06:41:38+00:00,"We had the wrong settings! To make the welds super flat & strong, we’re building a heavy duty, custom planisher, but just having the right settings is a major improvement."

457,2020-02-22 21:39:50+00:00,Getting there was super hard. Very proud of Tesla team!
458,2020-02-22 21:30:22+00:00,Model 3 achieves 350 mile actual range vs 310 EPA sticker in Consumer Reports testing
459,2020-02-22 03:29:45+00:00,"Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient & range, latter factoring in route elevation changes & cargo or tow mass & drag impact"
460,2020-02-22 03:22:21+00:00,It’s slightly better
461,2020-02-22 03:18:44+00:00,Definitely worth trying imo
462,2020-02-21 20:54:43+00:00,"Btw, in some prior tweets I’d said production Cybertruck would be ~80” wide (vs ~84” body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82”, but come standard with upper laser blade lights."
463,2020-02-21 19:48:55+00:00,Active ride height & active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
464,2020-02-21 11:16:44+00:00,Science has gone too far
465,2020-02-21 09:46:49+00:00, 
466,2020-02-20 23:54:53+00:00,F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production & thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
467,2020-02-20 23:44:28+00:00,"It’s mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light & back is heavy due to engines & landing legs."
468,2020-02-20 23:34:51+00:00,"Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main."
469,2020-02-20 23:32:58+00:00,LOX
470,2020-02-20 23:31:04+00:00,These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply #of iterations * progress between iterations.
471,2020-02-20 23:24:14+00:00,Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full & rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
472,2020-02-20 11:01:09+00:00,Probably
473,2020-02-20 10:52:39+00:00,Attach wheels to the landing legs & tow Starship to the launch pad
474,2020-02-20 10:50:19+00:00,I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
475,2020-02-20 10:29:23+00:00,"High bay for stacking Starship engine bay, propellant tanks & fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done!"
476,2020-02-20 06:01:22+00:00,"The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit"
477,2020-02-20 05:55:18+00:00,"There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine."
478,2020-02-20 05:50:34+00:00,"Header tanks are only ~2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal. Pressurized volume is still ~1000 cubic meters."
479,2020-02-20 05:48:48+00:00,"O2 header tank is tip of nosecone, CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank"
480,2020-02-20 05:42:14+00:00,In the order that they were written
481,2020-02-20 00:51:55+00:00,Worth reading Asimov’s Foundation https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series

496,2020-02-17 23:14:28+00:00,OpenAI should be more open imo
497,2020-02-16 01:24:28+00:00,"Initially, yes, but then will make sense to localize closer to customers. Pretty much same plan as vehicles."

543,2020-02-10 17:33:36+00:00,"No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it’s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles."

573,2020-02-07 07:52:53+00:00,"Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be <2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter."

575,2020-02-07 03:45:02+00:00,"Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering & building a heavy duty planisher to flatten & cold work the weld area"
576,2020-02-07 03:35:55+00:00,"That said, although substantial capital & engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume."
577,2020-02-07 03:31:23+00:00,"This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures & welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving."

672,2020-01-30 23:00:44+00:00,"Exactly. Mars propellant production will combine atmospheric CO2 & water (ice) to make CH4 (methane) & O2. Will do same on Earth long-term. Short-term, each Falcon flight uses roughly same fuel mass as a 747 flight. Falcon is ~71% oxygen & Starship is ~78%, so mostly not fuel."

736,2020-01-20 07:12:23+00:00,Exactly
737,2020-01-20 05:19:37+00:00,"Thanks on behalf of the @SpaceX team! Thank you also for the support @NASA has provided over the years, without which this would not have happened."

748,2020-01-17 21:55:53+00:00,"Munro’s analysis of Tesla engineering is accurate, both pro & con. I think he will appreciate some elements of the Model Y body design."
749,2020-01-17 10:31:00+00:00,"Even more important for a a reusable rocket, as cost of propellant actually becomes relevant & anything below T/W of 1 is wasted fuel & oxygen"

756,2020-01-17 02:05:51+00:00,Yeah. A lot of work is needed for propellant production on Mars.
757,2020-01-17 02:03:56+00:00,Yes
758,2020-01-17 02:03:03+00:00,That’s the goal
759,2020-01-17 02:01:37+00:00,Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync
760,2020-01-17 01:56:37+00:00,"Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at >100 tons/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit"
761,2020-01-17 01:46:26+00:00,Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary
762,2020-01-17 01:43:05+00:00,That’s about right

764,2020-01-16 22:51:19+00:00,"What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity."
765,2020-01-16 22:47:02+00:00,"Densification isn’t needed to return the ship & limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed"
766,2020-01-16 22:44:07+00:00,"Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! tragedy."
767,2020-01-16 22:41:18+00:00,"Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!"

771,2020-01-14 20:20:57+00:00,"Very true. What’s really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs & how little of it is absorbed by Earth. There is sooo much solar energy. We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earth’s surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun."
772,2020-01-14 20:14:59+00:00,"Advancing humanity’s understanding of the Universe is a fundamental motivator for SpaceX! Starship can put giant in orbit &amp; on moon. With an occluder, could image in other star systems."

795,2020-01-10 23:26:33+00:00,Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank — it’s just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don’t collapse when depressurized on the ground.
796,2020-01-10 23:24:10+00:00,"Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
797,2020-01-10 23:20:50+00:00,A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps & pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
798,2020-01-10 19:38:01+00:00,"Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts & better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."
799,2020-01-10 17:07:26+00:00,Great idea

838,2020-01-01 05:32:58+00:00,Carlos Gone
839,2019-12-31 21:37:06+00:00,It’s a bit slow
840,2019-12-31 06:59:34+00:00,It’s not ready yet
841,2019-12-31 06:57:57+00:00,Explains 
842,2019-12-31 02:27:28+00:00,Thanks all Tesla club members for helping out! Looking forward to seeing you there tomorrow. 
843,2019-12-30 23:27:10+00:00,Rest in peace Syd Mead. Your art will endure.
844,2019-12-30 23:09:08+00:00,C tbh
845,2019-12-30 23:00:08+00:00,"Many ways to solve this problem, but the power requirements are much higher than aircraft control surfaces. When moving giant body flaps rapidly, achieving high power is much harder than high torque."
846,2019-12-30 22:44:02+00:00,"Building prototypes is relatively easy, volume production is hard"
847,2019-12-30 22:41:38+00:00,Headed to Tesla Fremont factory tomorrow to help with vehicle deliveries
848,2019-12-30 22:39:21+00:00,Biting off more than I can chew. Because I’m an optimistic fool.
849,2019-12-30 10:05:01+00:00,Hard to believe it’s almost time to retire Cargo Dragon after a decade of solid service
850,2019-12-30 10:02:13+00:00,Exactly
851,2019-12-30 10:00:10+00:00,Will talk about that on Q4 call
852,2019-12-30 09:56:51+00:00,"Yeah, engineering is ~90% of my time at SpaceX & about ~60% at Tesla"
853,2019-12-30 09:18:31+00:00,Barrel on dome
854,2019-12-30 09:15:49+00:00,Took me an embarrassingly long time to learn that
855,2019-12-30 09:14:38+00:00,Sounds about right 
856,2019-12-30 08:51:08+00:00,Beyond awesome. He was the real deal.
857,2019-12-30 08:49:11+00:00,Seems so long ago
858,2019-12-30 08:03:12+00:00,Yes
859,2019-12-30 08:02:18+00:00,"Also, I hate deeply nested classes in C++. Had to be said."
860,2019-12-30 08:00:14+00:00,"The less code, the better! 1 point for adding a line of code, but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil."
861,2019-12-30 07:57:11+00:00,"Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter & more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It’s like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!"
862,2019-12-30 07:47:20+00:00,"Tesla merch def needs some love, but too many fish to fry rn"
863,2019-12-30 07:43:19+00:00,Coming …
864,2019-12-30 07:38:38+00:00,Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels & domes?
865,2019-12-30 07:32:50+00:00,We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship & Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
866,2019-12-30 07:26:18+00:00,Spin start from COPVs so the ox & fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
867,2019-12-30 07:17:20+00:00,"Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc & steel melt pool."
868,2019-12-30 07:09:23+00:00,"No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 & O2 from Raptor"
869,2019-12-30 07:04:28+00:00,Yeah
870,2019-12-30 07:01:44+00:00,"Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts & fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020."
871,2019-12-30 06:57:24+00:00,"Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed & TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints & 20% mass reduction."
872,2019-12-30 06:46:51+00:00,"We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome."
873,2019-12-30 06:17:24+00:00,Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome 
874,2019-12-30 04:58:04+00:00,Haha true
875,2019-12-30 04:55:21+00:00,muffin or not-muffin
876,2019-12-30 04:54:21+00:00,"Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship."
877,2019-12-30 04:05:38+00:00,"New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zeno’s Paradox — at any given point, you’re halfway there"
878,2019-12-30 03:59:39+00:00,"Crew Dragon should be physically ready & at the Cape in Feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months"
879,2019-12-30 03:45:55+00:00,Simulation of first crewed flight of Falcon 9 / Dragon 2020 @NASA
880,2019-12-30 03:25:48+00:00,"8 years later, the simulation is mostly real"
881,2019-12-30 03:15:24+00:00,Amazing work by Tesla China team!! 
882,2019-12-30 01:42:55+00:00, 
883,2019-12-30 01:40:20+00:00,Tesla app based payment will soon be rolled out WW. It’s tough making functionality work across so many regulatory domains.
884,2019-12-30 01:33:35+00:00,Is purchasing through the Tesla app not working?
885,2019-12-30 01:32:34+00:00,"I def believe in the ethical treatment of animals & taking action of climate, but these are mostly separate moral issues"
886,2019-12-30 01:26:26+00:00,Nice
887,2019-12-30 01:25:44+00:00,"Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation & electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isn’t critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!"
888,2019-12-30 01:18:33+00:00,Ok
889,2019-12-30 01:16:16+00:00,"I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy, but it’s true that everyone going vegan still wouldn’t stop climate change. Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere & oceans is fundamentally the issue."
890,2019-12-29 22:47:32+00:00, 
891,2019-12-29 22:46:21+00:00,Dam now rly want choc chip muffin
892,2019-12-29 22:41:49+00:00,Slight tweak to the glass needed & then it should be good to go
893,2019-12-29 22:40:00+00:00, 
894,2019-12-29 22:35:55+00:00,What is the platonic ideal of the perfect candy? Really feels like candy R&D hasn’t improved in ages. Damn candy oligarchs!! [shakes fist at sky]
895,2019-12-29 22:29:55+00:00,"Yeah, Boring Bricks are def coming, but whole team is focused on getting Vegas Convention Center tunnel operational so people can try it out, suggest improvements, etc. I crowdsourcing ideas with people who really care about making great products!"
896,2019-12-29 22:13:20+00:00,"Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever."
897,2019-12-29 11:23:01+00:00,"Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else & directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them."
898,2019-12-29 11:12:14+00:00,Pretty much
899,2019-12-29 11:09:56+00:00,Sure. Trax will get much better & more fun. This is an alpha version.
900,2019-12-29 11:03:51+00:00,"No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic & it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is."
901,2019-12-29 10:27:04+00:00,"That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted."
902,2019-12-29 10:08:01+00:00,"For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net."
903,2019-12-29 09:34:19+00:00,Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.
904,2019-12-29 08:21:06+00:00, you too sis
905,2019-12-29 07:57:44+00:00,Sorry about this. We will do our best. The Tesla production & delivery teams have been working super hard.
906,2019-12-29 06:01:58+00:00,Literally. It was at 40th & Baltimore in Philadelphia before gentrification.
907,2019-12-29 05:58:22+00:00,Ramones & Bach
908,2019-12-29 05:50:22+00:00,"I hope someone has pics! My Mom came to visit one weekend & was quite surprised by it all, but helped work coat check & guarded the cash with a kitchen knife "
909,2019-12-29 05:38:57+00:00,"To pay rent, we turned our house into a nightclub & charged a $5 entry fee. Looked cool at night, but insane by day … blacklights, luminescent spray paint & metal junk sculptures."
910,2019-12-29 02:14:35+00:00, you too
911,2019-12-29 01:03:06+00:00,Sounds like a Marxist with style
912,2019-12-29 00:23:50+00:00,Exactly
913,2019-12-29 00:09:51+00:00,"Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone."
914,2019-12-28 23:47:59+00:00,"This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack & suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan & a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship & debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton & Stanford."
915,2019-12-28 23:38:57+00:00,"This person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal?"
916,2019-12-28 23:22:36+00:00,"We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro & ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed). My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced & round would’ve happened anyway."
917,2019-12-28 22:42:53+00:00,"He didn’t own an emerald mine & I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night & website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?"
918,2019-12-28 22:30:09+00:00,Pretty much
919,2019-12-28 21:05:03+00:00,Federal
920,2019-12-28 21:04:32+00:00,Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals.
921,2019-12-28 21:01:45+00:00,Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.
922,2019-12-28 19:46:16+00:00,"Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too."
923,2019-12-28 04:20:23+00:00,"Yes, but it’s too secret"
924,2019-12-28 04:20:00+00:00,Hopefully fully operational in 2020
925,2019-12-28 04:18:27+00:00,"Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects"
926,2019-12-28 04:15:06+00:00,"No, he’s still much faster "
927,2019-12-28 04:13:38+00:00,"These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them."
928,2019-12-28 04:10:40+00:00,Done by dawn
929,2019-12-28 04:09:50+00:00,That would be a fringe benefit 
930,2019-12-28 04:06:37+00:00,"Build super safe, Earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic"
931,2019-12-28 02:56:20+00:00,Flight is hopefully 2 to 3 months away
932,2019-12-28 02:55:13+00:00,"We’re now building flight design of Starship SN1, but each SN will have at least minor improvements, at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0."
933,2019-12-27 19:50:28+00:00,Was up all night with SpaceX team working on Starship tank dome production (most difficult part of primary structure). Dawn arrives …
934,2019-12-27 08:54:35+00:00,Please stop spamming bleak links into a paywall
935,2019-12-26 23:55:11+00:00,Ok
936,2019-12-26 22:08:17+00:00,Activating engine two …
937,2019-12-26 20:18:29+00:00,It is an honor & a privilege to work with so many great engineers
938,2019-12-26 20:15:36+00:00,The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
939,2019-12-26 20:14:50+00:00,"It’s not that these things can’t be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers & merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware."
940,2019-12-26 19:19:20+00:00,Future feature
941,2019-12-26 19:08:37+00:00,"Turn on auto navigate feature & car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all."
942,2019-12-26 19:01:55+00:00,"Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone’s on data roaming & video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!"
943,2019-12-26 18:58:31+00:00,"Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) & side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home."
944,2019-12-26 18:55:00+00:00,We’re building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
945,2019-12-26 18:52:08+00:00,Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
946,2019-12-26 18:47:32+00:00,Most people still don’t know it’s there
947,2019-12-26 18:45:59+00:00,"Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar"
948,2019-12-26 18:40:40+00:00,"If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?"
949,2019-12-26 18:39:11+00:00,Merry Christmas Hope you’re enjoying latest software update!
950,2019-12-26 18:36:10+00:00,Yer welcome son
951,2019-12-26 18:35:41+00:00,"Car should autonavigate to destinations based on your calendar. If nothing in calendar, should do work in morning & home in evening. Future versions will guess based on prior patterns (if preference enabled)."
952,2019-12-26 18:33:11+00:00,That is odd. Try pressing both scroll wheel buttons to reboot. Have forwarded this to service.
953,2019-12-26 18:16:46+00:00,No
954,2019-12-26 18:03:55+00:00,Coming soon

975,2019-12-22 20:03:24+00:00,"Regarding 2.X to 3 hardware update, that should happen in earnest in Q1. Software feature delta was zero until now, so not much point in doing it before then."
976,2019-12-22 20:00:07+00:00,"Pretty much, although if there was a way to spend money to solve software problems sooner, I’d love it. The real constraint is finding great software engineers."
977,2019-12-22 19:55:53+00:00,Ok sure
978,2019-12-22 19:52:42+00:00,Sorry for the delay on V2.X! We just couldn’t get it all done in time.
979,2019-12-22 19:51:55+00:00,"Unfortunately, this has been necessary for many years, but hopefully not forever"
980,2019-12-22 19:47:53+00:00,"Sorry, it’s been a bit of a struggle. Software team has been working all weekend to resolve last minute issues. Hopefully starts rolling out tonight."
981,2019-12-22 19:38:51+00:00,"My wiki is a war zone with a zillion edits. At least it’s obviously not curated! Some day, I should probably write what *my* fictionalized version of reality is "
982,2019-12-22 19:32:25+00:00,Yes 
983,2019-12-22 19:30:32+00:00,"Started Zip2 with ~$2k & ~$100k of student debt, rolled proceeds into X/PayPal, rolled proceeds again into SpaceX/Tesla, but these are all companies where I played fundamental founding role. Not right to ask others to put in money if I don’t put in mine."

1005,2019-12-20 06:51:48+00:00,"Needs a few more days of validation, then early access, then wide release"
1006,2019-12-20 03:28:05+00:00,"Tesla holiday software update has FSD sneak preview, Stardew Valley, Lost Backgammon & a few other things"
1007,2019-12-19 08:44:18+00:00,You don’t hear much about element 43
1008,2019-12-19 08:40:07+00:00,"No, as that’s OG Mobileye hardware"
1009,2019-12-19 08:37:36+00:00,Cinnamon toast crunch
1010,2019-12-19 08:35:51+00:00,"This is quite a thorny hardware problem, as there are many diff versions of mcu & autopilot computer & supporting hardware. Cars last so much longer than phones! Hopefully able to upgrade mcu1 & ap2.0 in a few months."

1014,2019-12-19 07:56:53+00:00,"Yes, just costs a few thousand dollars & is more complex than a board swap. Bunch of connectors & antennas need to change. We can improve the speed a little with software optimization, which might be enough."
1015,2019-12-18 22:05:09+00:00,I think we can improve that with a little software optimization
1016,2019-12-18 21:55:01+00:00,This is a great meme 
1017,2019-12-18 21:45:56+00:00,MCU (infotainment computer) upgrade not recommended imo. Isn’t needed for full self-driving & cost is ~$2k for limited entertainment improvements.
1018,2019-12-18 21:41:16+00:00,"Never trust cynics, as they excuse their own bad deeds by telling themselves everyone does it"
1019,2019-12-18 02:53:18+00:00,"Yes, probably & partially"

1033,2019-12-12 21:06:08+00:00,We are literally a brain in a vat. The vat is your skull. Everything you think is real is an electrical signal. Feels so real though.
1034,2019-12-12 21:00:15+00:00,"Games only render what you look at when you look at it, as the compute load would otherwise be impossibly high. Until observed, objects are a probability function, aka quantum mechanics. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr&#xF6;dinger%27s_cat"

1045,2019-12-12 07:50:35+00:00,Of course
1046,2019-12-12 07:45:41+00:00,"If life is a video game, the graphics are great, but the plot is confusing & the tutorial is way too long"
1047,2019-12-12 07:38:00+00:00,Sure
1048,2019-12-12 07:32:58+00:00,Root of energy to mass ratio is max render speed of the simulation

1052,2019-12-11 09:38:51+00:00,That’s the one!
1053,2019-12-10 23:40:27+00:00,It really does
1054,2019-12-10 21:45:28+00:00,"They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! It’s pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars."
1055,2019-12-10 21:40:29+00:00,"Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‘93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed."
1056,2019-12-10 21:34:35+00:00,"Couldn’t afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that’s me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol."
1057,2019-12-10 19:17:56+00:00,Maybe on Starship? It’s def got the payload capacity …
1058,2019-12-10 19:12:24+00:00,Just wish Russ Mitchell would improve the *quality* of his fiction. Is this too much to ask!?

1060,2019-12-08 00:00:52+00:00,"We’ll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won’t do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck & almost died on one when I was 17."
1061,2019-12-07 23:57:35+00:00,Your Twitter comments are great btw!
1062,2019-12-07 23:56:40+00:00,Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. It’s better because of you! 
1063,2019-12-07 23:54:53+00:00,"This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they’d like in a product is a great way to meet their needs"
1064,2019-12-07 23:44:01+00:00,There will be no loss of either
1065,2019-12-07 23:14:15+00:00,"That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width"
1066,2019-12-07 23:10:16+00:00,"True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages."
1067,2019-12-07 23:02:49+00:00,We can prob reduce width by an inch & maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
1068,2019-12-07 20:19:59+00:00,Speed solves everything
1069,2019-12-07 05:06:31+00:00,"He’s def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km!

1079,2019-12-02 23:18:08+00:00,"People often think they’re breathing oxygen, but are actually breathing nitrogen (78%) with a side serving of oxygen (21%) in argon sauce (1%), spiced up with CO2, H2O & a dash of neon & krypton (etc.)"

1082,2019-12-01 21:01:24+00:00,We sent the nicest person in the company to sit on his doorstep until he at least talked to us & then he said yes
1083,2019-12-01 20:58:45+00:00,"Tesla was almost called Faraday, as original holder of Tesla Motors trademark refused to sell it to us!"
1084,2019-12-01 09:05:11+00:00,It’s artificial
1085,2019-12-01 08:48:16+00:00,Do you like our owl?
1086,2019-12-01 06:37:02+00:00,"Overall shape is good for low drag coefficient. Matters a lot exactly how you trip airflow at edges & guide air around wheels, like an invisible sculpture."
1087,2019-12-01 06:08:45+00:00,Laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated
1088,2019-12-01 05:15:27+00:00,That’s why Cybertruck has active suspension height & damping control
1089,2019-12-01 05:08:50+00:00,"Safety work is done by engineering, with passive safety by body/chassis eng & active by Autopilot. Design in automotive refers to look & feel."

1091,2019-12-01 04:56:41+00:00,It’s a generational thing
1092,2019-12-01 03:16:22+00:00,"With extreme effort, Cybertruck might hit a 0.30 drag coefficient, which would be insane for a truck. Requires tweaking many small details. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_drag_coefficient"

1102,2019-11-26 02:49:52+00:00,"Sure, will aim to do this next week"
1103,2019-11-26 02:46:38+00:00,"Agreed, this will be exciting to see!"
1104,2019-11-25 22:34:07+00:00,"Electric motors also have insane torque. If we load both trucks to the max, electric still wins. Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation."
1105,2019-11-25 22:19:38+00:00,Bring it on
1106,2019-11-25 20:58:10+00:00,Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo. Warthog irl!!

1108,2019-11-25 01:18:48+00:00,"Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time …"

1112,2019-11-24 23:35:14+00:00,We should def make it good to hang out there
1113,2019-11-24 22:02:01+00:00,"Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year"
1114,2019-11-24 21:32:32+00:00,"Good question. It’s a new variant of 300 series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press."
1115,2019-11-24 21:26:40+00:00,Can be wrapped in any color!
1116,2019-11-24 21:16:22+00:00,The body panels will actually be laser cut!
1117,2019-11-24 21:13:25+00:00,"Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too"
1118,2019-11-24 21:11:00+00:00,Interesting idea
1119,2019-11-24 21:10:18+00:00,True

1121,2019-11-24 21:07:22+00:00,Really? Ok sure.
1122,2019-11-24 21:06:05+00:00,Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level
1123,2019-11-24 21:01:27+00:00,"Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I’m confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity & lower part count."
1124,2019-11-24 20:51:45+00:00, Study the Blade!! 
1125,2019-11-24 20:45:09+00:00,"We’re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can’t be made using standard methods."
1126,2019-11-24 20:37:14+00:00,"Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger."
1127,2019-11-24 20:33:35+00:00,"Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made"
1128,2019-11-24 20:31:06+00:00,"Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press"
1129,2019-11-24 20:24:48+00:00,Excellent review by Marques!

1146,2019-11-22 15:13:20+00:00,Yes
1147,2019-11-22 14:47:21+00:00,"Will be an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day, possibly more. Would love this to be self-powered. Adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day. Avg miles per day in US is 30."
1148,2019-11-22 14:37:24+00:00,Tesla 2 person electric ATV will come at first as an option for Cybertruck
1149,2019-11-22 09:22:42+00:00,See ya in 2077

1162,2019-11-20 21:02:59+00:00,Maybe won’t need a key at all
1163,2019-11-20 19:31:11+00:00,"So many reporters gave Chanos airtime when he called Tesla a worthless fraud. Now that he has been proven wrong, silence …"
1164,2019-11-19 21:02:47+00:00,Gravitas is overrated
1165,2019-11-19 18:18:55+00:00,That would be cool

1170,2019-11-19 07:02:54+00:00,Cephalopods have a strange intelligence
1171,2019-11-19 06:58:33+00:00,It certainly does
1172,2019-11-19 06:38:55+00:00,True
1173,2019-11-18 18:54:31+00:00,Not sure. Maybe write or message carmakers who oppose the environmental initiative?
1174,2019-11-18 18:48:19+00:00,"Even Toyota, who made the Prius. That is sad."
1175,2019-11-18 18:40:54+00:00,Guess I was obsessed with space from an early age. Fair point.
1176,2019-11-18 05:16:21+00:00,I’d be way too embarrassed to put that on a Tesla. It’s like a kid’s drawing.
1177,2019-11-18 05:13:09+00:00,"Congratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too."
1178,2019-11-16 21:11:20+00:00,Exactly! Well said.
1179,2019-11-16 07:49:04+00:00,Surprisingly common
1180,2019-11-16 00:52:02+00:00,Cybertruck unveil Thursday night
1181,2019-11-15 19:02:17+00:00,Innovation comes in many ways
1182,2019-11-15 00:57:23+00:00,Meaning not fair that Boeing gets so much more for the same thing
1183,2019-11-15 00:55:08+00:00,This doesn’t seem right
1184,2019-11-14 06:02:20+00:00,True
1185,2019-11-14 03:50:30+00:00,Semi-infinite
1186,2019-11-14 03:47:33+00:00,Seems likely. = hipsters.
1187,2019-11-14 03:43:54+00:00,"Right now, trajectory of neuro-silicon symbiosis doesn’t appear to intersect trajectory of AGI. Goal of Neuralink is to raise this probability above 0.0%."
1188,2019-11-14 03:35:24+00:00,We fought the Balrog last year
1189,2019-11-14 03:31:14+00:00,Gentrify Mordor?
1190,2019-11-14 03:17:15+00:00,It was Tacheles
1191,2019-11-14 03:08:41+00:00,Memes are modern art
1192,2019-11-14 02:17:28+00:00,F8 irony

1195,2019-11-13 02:41:00+00:00,"Yeah, makes sense"
1196,2019-11-13 02:36:20+00:00,Congrats to Tesla team on Model 3 winning best midsize car in Germany! 
1197,2019-11-12 21:58:04+00:00,"Will build batteries, powertrains & vehicles, starting with Model Y"

1199,2019-11-12 18:16:39+00:00,Congratulations!
1200,2019-11-11 00:01:13+00:00,Starlink vertical on the pad
1201,2019-11-10 15:44:23+00:00,Yes
1202,2019-11-10 15:34:58+00:00,Haha
1203,2019-11-10 01:11:08+00:00,Exactly
1204,2019-11-10 00:40:18+00:00,"Without a fully & rapidly reusable orbital rocket, humanity will never be a multiplanet species"
1205,2019-11-09 19:18:25+00:00,Bad logic is always ugly
1206,2019-11-09 08:31:58+00:00,Same goes for digital super intelligence denial
1207,2019-11-08 07:24:26+00:00, 
1208,2019-11-08 03:53:10+00:00,141 MPGe!
1209,2019-11-08 03:37:26+00:00,Yes
1210,2019-11-08 01:06:04+00:00,Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
1211,2019-11-08 00:52:47+00:00,"SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle & no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."
1212,2019-11-08 00:41:31+00:00,"Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
1213,2019-11-08 00:14:46+00:00,Pretty much
1214,2019-11-08 00:14:14+00:00,"Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting & inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
1215,2019-11-08 00:10:42+00:00,"No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous & difficult than Earth & take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?"
1216,2019-11-07 21:17:43+00:00,"So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
1217,2019-11-07 21:16:09+00:00,As the planets align only once every two years
1218,2019-11-07 21:15:16+00:00,A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
1219,2019-11-07 21:07:05+00:00,No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
1220,2019-11-07 21:03:50+00:00,"Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
1221,2019-11-07 21:01:35+00:00,"If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles & each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
1222,2019-11-07 20:57:54+00:00,"Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"
1223,2019-11-07 20:52:51+00:00,The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
1224,2019-11-07 20:47:58+00:00,Gas/diesel cars too
1225,2019-11-07 20:47:44+00:00,True
1226,2019-11-07 19:42:09+00:00,Extremism is so fun! (@waitbutwhy)
1227,2019-11-06 17:36:24+00:00,Of course!
1228,2019-11-06 17:34:40+00:00,Yes
1229,2019-11-06 16:31:02+00:00,The date is strangely familiar …
1230,2019-11-06 16:15:32+00:00,Cybertruck unveil on Nov 21 in LA near SpaceX rocket factory
1231,2019-11-06 16:10:32+00:00,Looking into it
1232,2019-11-06 16:10:11+00:00,Yes
1233,2019-11-06 16:09:36+00:00,"The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF"
1234,2019-11-06 16:08:24+00:00,Naturally
1235,2019-11-06 15:40:02+00:00,This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” & I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
1236,2019-11-05 19:10:57+00:00,Fair point. Coming soon. We’re making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
1237,2019-11-05 19:07:35+00:00,"Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software."
1238,2019-11-05 17:20:50+00:00,More to come
1239,2019-11-05 15:50:23+00:00,Yes
1240,2019-11-05 01:20:03+00:00,Would be odd to expect anything else
1241,2019-11-04 23:26:20+00:00,"That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
1242,2019-11-04 22:14:24+00:00,"Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days & requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours & ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed."
1243,2019-11-04 22:03:08+00:00,Great poem
1244,2019-11-04 21:59:28+00:00,"Great work by SpaceX Dragon team & Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row."
1245,2019-11-01 14:32:37+00:00,"Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called “Low Gear”!"
1246,2019-11-01 02:34:49+00:00,Tesla Solarglass vs Happy Halloween!!
1247,2019-10-31 16:29:07+00:00,"Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong"
1248,2019-10-31 16:26:02+00:00,"Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there’s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 & 1/4 mile races."
1249,2019-10-30 21:56:18+00:00,Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!
1250,2019-10-30 17:59:49+00:00,Thank for helping grow sustainable energy through solar!
1251,2019-10-30 17:39:54+00:00,Congrats! Shopify is great btw. Nice work.
1252,2019-10-30 09:47:22+00:00,The fires are all too real
1253,2019-10-30 09:16:34+00:00,Haha true

1257,2019-10-30 02:05:30+00:00,"Soon, SpaceX will launch @NASA astronauts to @Space_Station!"
1258,2019-10-30 01:59:27+00:00,That’s significantly improved in current production
1259,2019-10-30 01:57:29+00:00,"True, my name literally means tree"

1265,2019-10-28 23:32:20+00:00,Sounds cool. Where are the trees being planted & what kind of trees?
1266,2019-10-28 21:37:57+00:00,Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended
1267,2019-10-28 21:33:58+00:00,"We’re changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires, earthquakes, etc"
1268,2019-10-28 21:32:17+00:00,"Very true. Glass doesn’t burn & melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs."
1269,2019-10-28 18:49:13+00:00,I hate advertising
1270,2019-10-28 18:46:09+00:00,"Unfortunately, it’s hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads & SEO. Go to http://tesla.com/solar to add solar to an existing roof &amp; http://Tesla.com/solarglass for a new roof with integrated solar."
1271,2019-10-28 18:10:47+00:00,"We don’t make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot"
1272,2019-10-28 18:09:19+00:00,"If you’re directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today"
1273,2019-10-28 18:04:13+00:00,"Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires"
1274,2019-10-28 17:57:17+00:00,So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas & being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
1275,2019-10-28 16:58:37+00:00,"Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important. https://www.zillow.com/research/solar-panels-house-sell-more-23798/amp/?__twitter_impression=true"
1276,2019-10-28 16:11:18+00:00,I’d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs
1277,2019-10-28 16:02:39+00:00,Extremely high

1326,2019-10-17 07:27:54+00:00,"Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine, which would double thrust loss. Also, thrust differential doesn’t solve roll control well."
1327,2019-10-17 05:50:58+00:00,"Common myth, but incorrect"
1328,2019-10-16 22:40:12+00:00,And so begins the robocalypse …
1329,2019-10-16 19:29:27+00:00,Tesla wins best headlights award https://twitter.com/Teslarati/status/1184548399028285443
1330,2019-10-16 12:20:25+00:00,"The final configuration used at Nürburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020, so this is not merely for the track"
1331,2019-10-15 22:18:33+00:00,Anyone who’s interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing — designing & building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We’re gonna take this to a whole new level!
1332,2019-10-15 22:10:33+00:00,Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
1333,2019-10-15 22:06:04+00:00,"So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you …"
1334,2019-10-15 21:45:36+00:00,"Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit."
1335,2019-10-15 21:42:02+00:00,"Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard"
1336,2019-10-15 05:51:41+00:00,And the lead character is also named Woody
1337,2019-10-15 01:28:53+00:00,"Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines"
1338,2019-10-14 22:17:27+00:00,Conservation of energy tells you the answer
1339,2019-10-14 22:15:29+00:00,Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
1340,2019-10-14 22:15:02+00:00,"We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place & only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room & moment of inertia is much lower."
1341,2019-10-14 22:09:01+00:00,"Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table"
1342,2019-10-14 22:07:53+00:00,"Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec."
1343,2019-10-14 22:04:12+00:00,"Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W > 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with >260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably <120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
1344,2019-10-14 21:56:36+00:00,Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect
1345,2019-10-14 21:50:31+00:00,"This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v"
1346,2019-10-14 21:42:07+00:00,"Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen & oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters."
1347,2019-10-14 21:36:05+00:00,"We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces."
1348,2019-10-14 21:34:24+00:00,"Yeah, great team!"
1349,2019-10-14 20:50:50+00:00,"To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth."
1350,2019-10-14 20:44:09+00:00,"Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere."
1351,2019-10-14 20:41:40+00:00,"Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space."
1352,2019-10-14 18:36:42+00:00,"Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear & drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly …"
1353,2019-10-14 16:30:37+00:00,Software
1354,2019-10-14 16:30:13+00:00,Yes
1355,2019-10-14 16:29:44+00:00,Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon
1356,2019-10-14 16:27:15+00:00,Venus would be very difficult
1357,2019-10-14 16:18:48+00:00,True
1358,2019-10-14 16:17:52+00:00,"Yes, we will"
1359,2019-10-14 16:09:19+00:00,"It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when & how fast to move the wipers."
1360,2019-10-14 16:03:51+00:00,"Deep Rain neural net coming soon. We’re not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets, just this one, because rain is deep."
1361,2019-10-14 04:04:00+00:00,"Yep, good catch"
1362,2019-10-14 04:01:59+00:00, hot pot
1363,2019-10-14 03:20:26+00:00,Cybertruck doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen bouncing around the Internet. It’s closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future.
1364,2019-10-14 03:07:35+00:00,Those rumors are false
1365,2019-10-13 22:28:12+00:00,Coming v soon
1366,2019-10-13 20:58:45+00:00,Haha

1369,2019-10-13 09:27:47+00:00,Space Jam should’ve won the Oscar
1370,2019-10-13 03:31:02+00:00,Recommended for sure. Both movies are incredible.
1371,2019-10-13 03:25:36+00:00,"First will rewatch Godfather Part II, then Space Jam"
1372,2019-10-13 03:22:17+00:00,"Underappreciated , will watch!"
1373,2019-10-13 03:20:15+00:00,Is Space Jam good?
1374,2019-10-13 02:03:21+00:00,So it goes
1375,2019-10-13 01:51:57+00:00,Sure looks that way
1376,2019-10-12 22:49:29+00:00,Nice 
1377,2019-10-12 22:42:15+00:00,Solar
1378,2019-10-12 22:42:07+00:00,"Depends on total system efficiency & how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so 1 to 10MW as a rough guess"
1379,2019-10-12 20:53:05+00:00,"Whoa, that does look good!"
1380,2019-10-12 20:36:58+00:00,Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date.
1381,2019-10-12 20:32:25+00:00,French fries are the devil 
1382,2019-10-12 20:18:25+00:00,".@DrPatSoonShiong, are you aware that one of your senior journalists (Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?"
1383,2019-10-12 19:46:57+00:00,Super messed up situation!
1384,2019-10-12 18:11:26+00:00,Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.
1385,2019-10-12 18:05:06+00:00,Should be much better at this point
1386,2019-10-12 01:22:03+00:00,Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
1387,2019-10-12 01:20:38+00:00,"Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …"
1388,2019-10-12 01:19:19+00:00,"Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist."
1389,2019-10-12 01:17:24+00:00,Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
1390,2019-10-12 01:16:48+00:00,"V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout."
1391,2019-10-12 01:13:27+00:00,"When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many & much better than driving a single car."
1392,2019-10-12 01:09:35+00:00,Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
1393,2019-10-12 01:07:02+00:00, 
1394,2019-10-12 01:06:28+00:00,"Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released."
1395,2019-10-12 01:03:30+00:00,"Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive."
1396,2019-10-12 01:01:26+00:00,"Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1"
1397,2019-10-12 00:18:22+00:00,Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power & no more blackouts!
1398,2019-10-12 00:00:26+00:00,Will be throughout Canada
1399,2019-10-11 17:35:59+00:00,It’s something special
1400,2019-10-10 16:08:52+00:00,Fundamental metric of good of Tesla is how many years sooner it brings the advent of a sustainable energy future
1401,2019-10-10 07:13:54+00:00,True 
1402,2019-10-10 07:03:23+00:00,I Asterix &amp; Obelix!
1403,2019-10-10 07:01:47+00:00,Exactly
1404,2019-10-10 06:57:32+00:00,Ok
1405,2019-10-10 00:25:22+00:00,Also adding Tesla Solar to our Supercharger stations as fast as possible. Goal is 24/7 clean power with no blackouts.
1406,2019-10-10 00:23:28+00:00,All Tesla Supercharger stations in regions affected by California power outages will have Tesla Powerpacks within next few weeks. Just waiting on permits.

1435,2019-10-08 15:03:11+00:00,All hardware is at the Cape. Need to do static fire and reconfigure for flight. Launch probably late Nov / early Dec.
1436,2019-10-08 14:57:32+00:00,"We had to reallocate some resources to speed this up & received great support from Airborne, our parachute supplier. I was at their Irvine factory with the SpaceX team on Sat and Sun. We’re focusing on the advanced Mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts."

1443,2019-10-07 19:49:15+00:00,Haha true
1444,2019-10-07 07:50:47+00:00,Done
1445,2019-10-07 06:04:33+00:00,Trouble!
1446,2019-10-07 05:47:49+00:00,And that’s just the tip of the iceberg
1447,2019-10-07 04:56:28+00:00,Agreed
1448,2019-10-06 21:26:07+00:00,Good ones
1449,2019-10-06 19:33:05+00:00,"Agreed, fair point"
1450,2019-10-06 19:28:43+00:00,Any feature requests?

1458,2019-10-05 18:39:18+00:00,True
1459,2019-10-05 18:38:22+00:00,To understand the nature of consciousness
1460,2019-10-05 03:17:05+00:00,It’s true 
1461,2019-10-04 23:33:02+00:00,Exactly
1462,2019-10-04 16:57:24+00:00,Great list of hotel hacks in this thread!

1473,2019-10-02 22:31:11+00:00,Aiming for this weekend!
1474,2019-10-02 22:26:53+00:00,"Hopefully, a month or two, although it may be a little silly at first"
1475,2019-10-02 22:25:21+00:00,Not yet

1477,2019-10-02 22:16:45+00:00,"Over 550,000 Tesla Smart Summon uses in first few days!"
1478,2019-10-02 22:12:57+00:00,"Thanks, Tesla team is the strongest it’s ever been & doing an amazing job! Honored to work beside them."

1480,2019-10-01 22:16:31+00:00,Great summary of the key points!
1481,2019-10-01 22:00:22+00:00,"That’s about right, except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot & have to be replaced."
1482,2019-10-01 18:56:04+00:00,"It’s all the “secondary” structure that concerns me, not engines & primary airframe"
1483,2019-10-01 18:55:18+00:00,"Raptor cost is tracking to well under $1M for V1.0. Goal is <$250k for V2.0 is a 250 ton thrust-optimized engine, ie <$1000/ton"
1484,2019-10-01 17:46:10+00:00,Stop sending me this 
1485,2019-10-01 17:02:46+00:00,Agreed & such a heartwarming photo 
1486,2019-10-01 17:01:41+00:00,I have that exact thought every time I get the flu
1487,2019-10-01 16:42:49+00:00,Clearly a sign of the apocalypse!
1488,2019-10-01 08:55:58+00:00,Lot of ways to melt & join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently & with precise parts.
1489,2019-10-01 08:53:41+00:00,Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right & not needed with steel.
1490,2019-10-01 07:42:04+00:00,"Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see"
1491,2019-10-01 07:29:38+00:00,Bigger flaps/fins at rear also moves center of pressure back

1495,2019-10-01 05:32:20+00:00,Cool video!
1496,2019-09-30 23:46:59+00:00,"Probably our most viral feature ever. Most of the Autopilot team has been working on this, led by Ashok, CJ, Andrej & many others."
1497,2019-09-30 23:01:29+00:00,Good question

1509,2019-09-27 17:04:43+00:00,There’s so much power going through this engine that it’s close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
1510,2019-09-27 17:00:05+00:00,Yes
1511,2019-09-27 16:59:17+00:00,"Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints & dissimilar metals at such high pressure & temperature is what I find remarkable about it."
1512,2019-09-27 16:34:09+00:00,"No, we’ve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have & we’ll get around to it, but not needed for flight."
1513,2019-09-27 16:31:41+00:00,Probably around 6 or 7pm
1514,2019-09-27 16:28:45+00:00,"What blows my mind is that peak pressure in regen chamber & nozzle is *far* above combustion pressure at over 800 bar or ~12,000 psi"

1530,2019-09-26 05:20:31+00:00,That would be a nice touch
1531,2019-09-26 04:59:13+00:00,"This is quite a complex beast, but hopefully within a month or so"
1532,2019-09-26 04:56:47+00:00,Haha awesome
1533,2019-09-26 04:18:37+00:00,We could probably do that

1551,2019-09-24 19:58:20+00:00,It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery!
1552,2019-09-24 19:55:14+00:00,"This includes original engineering of new factory processes & cars. Great engineers will only join if original engineering is supported, not just localization."

1554,2019-09-24 18:37:07+00:00,"For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise."
1555,2019-09-24 18:17:06+00:00,"Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling & quite robust"
1556,2019-09-24 18:14:58+00:00,"Better just to ride your max temp all the way down & let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing."
1557,2019-09-24 18:10:42+00:00,"Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat."
1558,2019-09-24 18:04:08+00:00,"It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating"
1559,2019-09-24 18:03:06+00:00,"Many powerful electric motors & batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the 28th."

1575,2019-09-22 17:31:12+00:00,Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle & ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
1576,2019-09-22 17:20:27+00:00,"For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass & pressure."
1577,2019-09-22 17:13:05+00:00,"Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2"
1578,2019-09-22 17:06:46+00:00,"Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear & fwd fins during entry & landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg."
1579,2019-09-22 16:55:38+00:00,Stability is not an issue with 3
1580,2019-09-22 16:54:26+00:00,"Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors & rear fins at the bottom."
1581,2019-09-22 16:51:03+00:00,"Yes. There’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven’t closed it out."

1654,2019-09-14 19:54:31+00:00,"However, we won’t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla & customer legal bill to be high & drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense."

Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries & drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs & improve logistics worldwide."
1657,2019-09-14 17:59:08+00:00,"Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
1658,2019-09-14 17:53:24+00:00,"That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous & possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it"
1659,2019-09-14 17:51:01+00:00,"At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
1660,2019-09-14 17:45:58+00:00,"The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally & should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."
1661,2019-09-14 17:25:44+00:00,Agreed
1662,2019-09-14 17:10:01+00:00,"Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
1663,2019-09-14 17:03:08+00:00,"There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
1664,2019-09-14 16:56:24+00:00,"Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."
1665,2019-09-14 05:31:14+00:00,"Hopefully, next year"
1666,2019-09-14 05:20:08+00:00,"Personally, I think the universe looks great for 12 billion years, let alone 13.8"

1676,2019-09-12 21:41:49+00:00,This is technically a Speedraptor

1689,2019-09-12 01:54:19+00:00,"Yes. To be clear, Plaid powertrain is about a year away from production & applies to S,X & Roadster, but not 3 or Y. Will cost more than our current offerings, but less than competitors."
1690,2019-09-12 01:42:25+00:00,No

1698,2019-09-11 06:12:29+00:00,"But we probably won’t try for best lap time this week, as we need to review & tune Model S thoroughly for safety on Nürburgring, especially Flugplatz section"
1699,2019-09-11 06:01:06+00:00,Model S is already there

1711,2019-09-10 09:24:38+00:00,Will be answered on 28th
1712,2019-09-10 08:09:14+00:00,Exactly
1713,2019-09-10 08:07:56+00:00,Looks good
1714,2019-09-10 08:05:59+00:00,The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration & acoustics.
1715,2019-09-10 06:30:49+00:00,48 61 20 68 61
1716,2019-09-10 06:26:25+00:00,"The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal."
1717,2019-09-09 23:05:41+00:00,"Failure rate is actually both higher & lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate."
1718,2019-09-09 22:01:53+00:00,Precisely
1719,2019-09-09 20:39:45+00:00,"Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox & fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok."
1720,2019-09-09 20:23:18+00:00, 
1721,2019-09-09 20:22:22+00:00,You know destination weather before departure & there’s no weather in space
1722,2019-09-09 19:20:01+00:00,"Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins."
1723,2019-09-09 18:18:16+00:00,"Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell & fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull."
1724,2019-09-09 18:13:10+00:00,"Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that’s not indicative of capability."
1725,2019-09-09 18:08:59+00:00,"Over time, 355 & 385 are possible, but very difficult"
1726,2019-09-09 18:07:08+00:00,Most likely
1727,2019-09-09 17:52:42+00:00,Photoshop is amazing
1728,2019-09-09 17:51:16+00:00,"Sea level Raptor’s vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle"

1738,2019-09-09 02:35:39+00:00,Why aren’t more people talking about this!?
1739,2019-09-08 02:56:21+00:00,Sounds about right
1740,2019-09-08 02:41:14+00:00,It’s not
1741,2019-09-07 23:23:50+00:00,"Over time, it will be 100% sustainable"

1744,2019-09-07 22:48:57+00:00,Also
1745,2019-09-07 20:17:55+00:00,"Without the removal fee, Tesla Solar is unequivocally a guaranteed, instant money printer, producing $300 to $1000 per year (in after tax income!)"
1746,2019-09-07 20:13:13+00:00,"For the remainder of September, Tesla is permanently waiving the $1500 solar removal fee requirement. Note, the ability to stop monthly payments at any time remains."
1747,2019-09-07 19:53:06+00:00,Definitely for Space Force. We need to make Starfleet real.
1748,2019-09-07 19:48:59+00:00,"Very exciting to see India’s rapid progress in space! There are always setbacks, of course, but I think India is doing great overall."
1749,2019-09-07 19:42:43+00:00,Yes
1750,2019-09-07 19:40:26+00:00,"Thanks for offering! Sure, that would be great."
1751,2019-09-07 19:18:38+00:00,We might be in one right now
1752,2019-09-07 19:18:18+00:00,"No, probably V10.1"
1753,2019-09-07 19:16:31+00:00,"Merging code branches & one more QA-level release this week. Hopefully, EAP wide release week after."
1754,2019-09-07 19:12:01+00:00,"Looking good. Smart summon is almost great. Drive-in theater mode, caraoke & Cuphead are awesome."
1755,2019-09-07 19:08:57+00:00, 
1756,2019-09-07 18:47:01+00:00,For sure on first crewed missions for exactly that reason

1778,2019-09-05 16:09:15+00:00,"Still too buggy to be in wide EAP. Requires more testing. Hopefully, going to wide EAP next week."
1779,2019-09-05 07:25:21+00:00,It’s up to &amp; as to whether they go with EU rules or rest of world. Not our choice.
1780,2019-09-04 20:47:52+00:00,"Same, except where limited by EU regulations. We’re aware of extreme consumer unhappiness about this & are working with EU regulators to address."

1830,2019-08-25 07:19:40+00:00,It’s quite robust
1831,2019-08-24 21:49:43+00:00,Where are additional Superchargers most needed?
1832,2019-08-24 21:48:41+00:00,World’s first very large scale battery has worked out well
1833,2019-08-24 21:42:05+00:00,"Yes, last flight for Hopper. If all goes well, it will become a vertical test stand for Raptor."
1834,2019-08-24 21:40:51+00:00,Exactly! Especially let your PUC commissioners/authorities know.
1835,2019-08-24 21:39:21+00:00,"Agreed, that’s the right future"
1836,2019-08-24 21:38:10+00:00,Looks like @SpaceX Starhopper flight may be as soon as Monday. FAA support is much appreciated!
1837,2019-08-24 21:32:50+00:00,We’re working closely with EU regulators & hope to clarify the timeline soon
1838,2019-08-24 21:18:35+00:00,Ok
1839,2019-08-24 21:18:30+00:00,Should be soon
1840,2019-08-24 21:15:05+00:00,"If you’re a utility or public utilities commission, please consider using the Tesla Megapack. Better for the environment & usually lower cost than fossil fuel peaker plants!"
1841,2019-08-24 16:09:30+00:00,"Yes, probably within next 6 to 9 months"
1842,2019-08-24 16:03:21+00:00,Tesla is working hard to help stop global warming

1846,2019-08-23 16:01:16+00:00,Ok
1847,2019-08-21 19:03:48+00:00,"We need to complete internal QA testing for safety, which will hopefully be done in about 4 weeks"
1848,2019-08-21 06:53:39+00:00,Wow
1849,2019-08-20 23:46:21+00:00,Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
1850,2019-08-20 19:59:58+00:00,"Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes"
1851,2019-08-20 19:25:50+00:00,"Not risky imo & can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun)."
1852,2019-08-20 19:19:45+00:00,"True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids & a mass driver, but this is risky."
1853,2019-08-20 19:12:46+00:00,"Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive."
1854,2019-08-20 19:03:23+00:00,"Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins & landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September"
1855,2019-08-20 18:58:57+00:00,Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
1856,2019-08-20 18:57:07+00:00,"Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth & gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming"
1857,2019-08-20 18:07:16+00:00, 
1858,2019-08-20 18:05:49+00:00,Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
1859,2019-08-20 17:58:29+00:00,"AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It’s mostly design-review based, not flight-based."
1860,2019-08-20 17:49:08+00:00,"Yeah, would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters"
1861,2019-08-20 17:47:47+00:00,"Initially Model 3, later Y"
1862,2019-08-20 17:44:11+00:00,Looking forward to seeing Giga Shanghai soon Amazing work by Tesla China team &amp; support of authorities much appreciated!

1869,2019-08-18 21:26:26+00:00,"Great name! Wouldn’t worry about this particular one, but a big rock will hit Earth eventually & we currently have no defense."
1870,2019-08-18 20:06:39+00:00,"Don’t know yet, but it’s important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy, so we’ll make costs as low as possible"

1874,2019-08-18 09:30:53+00:00,Tesla Solar just relaunched. Lmk what you think …
1875,2019-08-18 09:23:04+00:00,Which means a small corner of Texas (or anywhere) with solar panels could power the entire United States
1876,2019-08-18 09:19:30+00:00,1 Gigawatt per square kilometer of solar energy reaches Earth’s surface
1877,2019-08-18 09:11:35+00:00,In a few years

1880,2019-08-18 08:10:19+00:00,It is quite silly
1881,2019-08-18 08:08:58+00:00,Meaning less than a century. But this would be pretty intense.
1882,2019-08-18 08:08:11+00:00,"Aspirationally, decades"

1884,2019-08-18 08:01:01+00:00,Yes
1885,2019-08-18 07:59:54+00:00,"Not saying it solves everything, mind you, but it’s a step in the right direction"
1886,2019-08-18 00:05:10+00:00,"Yeah, the trick is opening & closing the spacesuit helmet really fast"
1887,2019-08-17 17:52:57+00:00,Stop hashtagging me 
1888,2019-08-17 15:15:35+00:00,Perhaps that one was too edgy …
1889,2019-08-17 07:45:49+00:00,Hashtags are an abomination

1900,2019-08-16 04:24:29+00:00,I’d play that game
1901,2019-08-16 04:23:22+00:00,Nuke Mars!
1902,2019-08-16 00:55:15+00:00,This isn’t correct. Will address.
1903,2019-08-15 20:19:20+00:00,Good conversation with head of FAA Space. Need a bit more hazard analysis & should be clear to fly soon.
1904,2019-08-15 18:20:35+00:00,Am talking to @FAA in a few hours
1905,2019-08-15 18:19:21+00:00,"Stacking fairing & tanks soon, then adding control fins, engines & landing gear"
1906,2019-08-15 18:14:57+00:00,That was my actual password at one point!

1916,2019-08-14 06:58:49+00:00,True
1917,2019-08-14 06:30:35+00:00,No but srsly don’t do it
1918,2019-08-13 16:02:46+00:00,Roughly
1919,2019-08-11 19:50:57+00:00,Ok
1920,2019-08-11 19:44:58+00:00,Possibly two weeks
1921,2019-08-11 19:42:57+00:00,Try playing Powerglide in your Tesla at volume 11

1929,2019-08-10 01:35:34+00:00,Passing fad. Like steam engines. They look cool in a museum.
1930,2019-08-10 01:32:04+00:00,Because our universe is actually a microverse in a miniverse. We probably just power someone’s brake lights. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JtgQskSb4QY
1931,2019-08-09 23:29:15+00:00,"Will be needed for sure. Bandwidth, no problem, latency is a challenge "
1932,2019-08-09 23:25:52+00:00,"Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes"
1933,2019-08-09 23:23:14+00:00,"Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully & immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly . Even though I’m immersed in Starship/Raptor design &amp; build 7 days/week, it still doesn’t feel real."

1938,2019-08-09 23:06:35+00:00,Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
1939,2019-08-09 23:05:29+00:00,For sure
1940,2019-08-09 23:03:28+00:00,Yup
1941,2019-08-09 22:53:15+00:00,Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.
1942,2019-08-09 19:01:41+00:00,Gas cars are so last-century!
1943,2019-08-09 17:35:28+00:00,Priority / early access will be automatic for all owners with FSD
1944,2019-08-09 08:01:12+00:00,"We’re accelerating opening up configurator/order page for more countries. Sorry, lot on our plate!"
1945,2019-08-09 07:52:29+00:00,"Probably every 2 to 4 months, depending on how much progress we make"
1946,2019-08-09 07:50:54+00:00,Video is amazing with the Tesla sound system. Will include Caraoke!
1947,2019-08-09 07:46:31+00:00,FSD owners will get priority in the upload queue
1948,2019-08-09 07:37:49+00:00,Thanks for reminding me. Will rectify.
1949,2019-08-09 07:28:38+00:00,Tons of fun!

1955,2019-08-09 01:05:04+00:00,No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
1956,2019-08-09 01:02:03+00:00,"Wouldn’t read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights."
1957,2019-08-09 00:57:45+00:00,Thanks George!
1958,2019-08-08 19:00:34+00:00,"We’re working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesn’t quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world."
1959,2019-08-08 06:46:37+00:00,But actual road data is what matters most
1960,2019-08-08 06:32:23+00:00,"Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident."
1961,2019-08-08 06:19:50+00:00,"Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff …"
1962,2019-08-08 06:05:24+00:00,Well said!
1963,2019-08-07 07:05:54+00:00,Ok

1973,2019-08-06 04:20:14+00:00,"Not in current plans, but that may change"
1974,2019-08-06 04:16:11+00:00,No
1975,2019-08-06 04:15:50+00:00,"Vandenberg is great for polar orbits. Will still play an important role long-term, but 80%+ will be eastward."

2005,2019-08-04 04:27:56+00:00,"Yes, detailed review of the first orbital Starship, explaining the pros & cons of each design decision"
2006,2019-08-04 02:48:41+00:00,We are tiny
2007,2019-08-04 01:09:09+00:00,"Very convincing! Ok, Boca it is. We should have Starship Mk1 with 3 Raptors almost ready to fly by then."
2008,2019-08-04 00:21:13+00:00,I would’ve been bankrupt too. Unlikely investors would have funded a second attempt.
2009,2019-08-04 00:04:23+00:00,Relief
2010,2019-08-04 00:03:42+00:00,"Ok, will discuss with team"
2011,2019-08-04 00:01:23+00:00,Sure
2012,2019-08-03 23:57:00+00:00,"Also, you can request any service from the Tesla phone app in under a minute"
2013,2019-08-03 23:53:53+00:00,"August 24th, either at Cape Canaveral or Boca Chica"
2014,2019-08-03 23:44:43+00:00,"That was our last chance to reach orbit. If it had failed, SpaceX would have died."
2015,2019-08-03 06:41:01+00:00,Yes
2016,2019-08-03 06:40:18+00:00,Will also be launching The Boring Company China on this trip
2017,2019-08-02 20:40:57+00:00,Good idea
2018,2019-08-02 19:39:14+00:00,You’re most welcome!
2019,2019-08-01 19:59:23+00:00,Fates loves irony
2020,2019-08-01 17:59:10+00:00,"For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes."
2021,2019-08-01 17:02:39+00:00,Not sure. Will check with my team.
2022,2019-08-01 16:54:44+00:00,"I’m told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable."
2023,2019-08-01 16:52:14+00:00,"Orbital refilling is vital to humanity’s future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first."
2024,2019-07-31 23:59:50+00:00,Fixing …
2025,2019-07-31 21:01:45+00:00,Depot haha
2026,2019-07-31 21:01:11+00:00,Mailing Dragon dock with Space Station is much harder than docking with our own ship for refilling. Not a problem.
2027,2019-07-31 02:45:16+00:00,Never thought we’d make it this far
2028,2019-07-31 02:24:26+00:00,Ancient times …
2029,2019-07-30 00:54:48+00:00,Spooling up production line rapidly. Hoping to manufacture ~1000 solar roofs/week by end of this year.
2030,2019-07-29 23:56:11+00:00,Tesla Megapack now available for utility-scale energy storage
2031,2019-07-28 20:38:42+00:00,"Thanks Jason! Super proud to work with such great teams at SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink and Boring!!"
2032,2019-07-28 19:54:33+00:00,Falcon rocket reentry from space with double sonic booms
2033,2019-07-28 09:50:00+00:00,"Now that Hopper has flown, Starship update probably in two weeks or so."
2034,2019-07-28 09:46:07+00:00,Falcon 9 piercing the sound barrier on reentry
2035,2019-07-28 08:37:58+00:00,Thanks for letting me know
2036,2019-07-28 04:50:38+00:00,You can
2037,2019-07-28 02:35:47+00:00,Vehicle alert seen show up automatically & enable single touch request for service for that item either from the car screen or mobile app
2038,2019-07-28 02:33:54+00:00,System automatically selects between mobile service & service center appointment. Say prefer mobile in comments to bias. We will add a check box for mobile preferred.
2039,2019-07-28 01:44:20+00:00,Tesla owners can schedule service appointments in under a minute just using their Tesla phone app!
2040,2019-07-28 01:41:57+00:00,"We’re working on it. Agreed, Minecraft is high priority. Roblox too."
2041,2019-07-28 01:39:44+00:00,Sure
2042,2019-07-28 01:37:38+00:00,Haha probably true (sigh)
2043,2019-07-28 01:33:28+00:00,"Depends on how release to owners with early access goes, but hopefully wide release by end of August"
2044,2019-07-28 01:28:48+00:00,Tesla Service Centers & a lot more Superchargers coming to Poland later this year
2045,2019-07-28 00:54:25+00:00,Will recognize & read all signs for FSD. Focused on traffic lights & stop signs right now. Most are very easy. Difficulty is millions of corner cases.
2046,2019-07-28 00:50:52+00:00,"Hoping to get “Joe Mode” into V10. The default, of course, is normal volume, but selecting “Joe Mode” would lower the volume of strident beeps & chimes by half."
2047,2019-07-28 00:43:21+00:00,"If not immediately, will be followed shortly in a point release"
2048,2019-07-28 00:40:22+00:00,Yes
2049,2019-07-28 00:40:05+00:00,Some
2050,2019-07-28 00:39:48+00:00,"Not currently in V10, but will try"
2051,2019-07-28 00:38:18+00:00,"Yes, V10 will include several games & infotainment features, improved highway Autopilot, better traffic light & stop sign recognition & Smart Summon"
2052,2019-07-27 18:56:04+00:00,Can’t you just play though phone Bluetooth?
2053,2019-07-27 18:32:29+00:00,"We’re close, but the magic is in the final details. Maybe 2 to 3 months."
2054,2019-07-27 18:30:07+00:00,"Maybe August, not more than a few months"
2055,2019-07-27 18:20:41+00:00,"Yeah, feels just like an old school drive in movie experience, but with much better sound"
2056,2019-07-27 18:16:17+00:00,"When full self-driving is approved by regulators, we will enable video while moving"
2057,2019-07-27 18:15:32+00:00,"Ability to stream YouTube & Netflix when car is stopped coming to your Tesla soon! Has an amazingly immersive, cinematic feel due to the comfy seats & surround sound audio."
2058,2019-07-27 18:00:18+00:00,"Yes, really enjoyed it, although wish she’d made it up to sky city"
2059,2019-07-27 16:23:58+00:00,"Unity port is done, so finessing the controls now. Mostly limited by local storage. Will allow additional game storage via USB. Whatever’s most fun!"
2060,2019-07-27 16:20:04+00:00,And those who weren’t expecting a ternary joke
2061,2019-07-27 16:17:58+00:00,Will run v high res at 60 fps. Cuphead doesn’t need 4k.
2062,2019-07-27 16:07:15+00:00,Cuphead for Tesla coming out in August
2063,2019-07-27 04:02:15+00:00,Space fairies are real

2066,2019-07-26 08:48:36+00:00,Drone cam
2067,2019-07-26 08:30:22+00:00,Thanks!
2068,2019-07-26 05:49:13+00:00,Engine cam
2069,2019-07-26 04:11:27+00:00,Yes
2070,2019-07-26 04:07:03+00:00,200m hop in a week or two
2071,2019-07-26 03:49:11+00:00,Starhopper flight successful. Water towers *can* fly haha!!
2072,2019-07-26 00:05:06+00:00,"Btw, you can schedule service via the Tesla app in less than a minute"
2073,2019-07-25 23:07:51+00:00,Good point. Getting fixed …
2074,2019-07-25 22:19:52+00:00,Probably 1/4 to 1/2 of that capacity would be for stationary storage
2075,2019-07-25 22:02:45+00:00,Launch underway
2076,2019-07-25 05:37:49+00:00,"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"
2077,2019-07-25 05:24:34+00:00,Pc (chamber pressure) high due to colder than expected propellant
2078,2019-07-25 03:19:06+00:00,Thin tiles on windward side of ship & nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option
2079,2019-07-25 01:01:03+00:00,"Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe."
2080,2019-07-25 00:51:39+00:00,Wearing black not recommended
2081,2019-07-25 00:46:50+00:00,"High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren’t hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective."
2082,2019-07-24 21:56:49+00:00,One Space Station image for each visit
2083,2019-07-24 18:12:54+00:00,Me too
2084,2019-07-24 17:28:53+00:00,"In a million years, the Universe will go from being 13.772 to 13.773 billion years old. Like tears in the rain …"
2085,2019-07-23 06:45:04+00:00,Exciting modes!
2086,2019-07-23 01:42:03+00:00,True 
2087,2019-07-22 23:15:54+00:00,
2088,2019-07-22 23:13:31+00:00,Time to face reality
2089,2019-07-22 22:33:53+00:00,We’re all just made of two quarks & a lepton
2090,2019-07-22 21:49:55+00:00,Center 7 engines gimbal to 15 degrees
2091,2019-07-22 21:48:45+00:00, 
2092,2019-07-22 21:41:09+00:00,"For 37 engine config, 6 are mounted outboard under landing leg fairings"
2093,2019-07-22 21:39:51+00:00,"Outer engines stick out slightly from 9m diameter, don’t gimbal & are mechanically joined at nozzle"
2094,2019-07-22 19:06:22+00:00, tough
2095,2019-07-22 19:04:52+00:00,"To be clear: good for in-space transit, but not recommended for Earth to orbit!"
2096,2019-07-22 19:03:48+00:00,Very unlikely
2097,2019-07-22 19:02:19+00:00,Goodbye 
2098,2019-07-22 18:58:24+00:00,Nuclear thermal rocket for fast transit around solar system would be a great area of research for @NASA
2099,2019-07-22 07:41:34+00:00,Do EV owners use V to G a lot in Australia?
2100,2019-07-22 06:01:55+00:00,"Probably have slots for up to 37 engines, but can decontent as needed. Starship update after Hopper hover."
2101,2019-07-22 04:10:58+00:00,I am become meme
2102,2019-07-22 04:06:14+00:00,Dance Dance 
2103,2019-07-22 03:26:46+00:00,Next year’s @Hyperloop competition will be in a 10km vacuum tunnel with a curve
2104,2019-07-22 03:03:07+00:00,
2105,2019-07-22 02:43:58+00:00,Woohoo 
2106,2019-07-22 02:16:17+00:00,"Orbital refilling is critical for high payload to moon or Mars. Initially just Starship to Starship, later dedicated tankers."
2107,2019-07-22 02:08:15+00:00,водка means cute water
2108,2019-07-22 01:59:16+00:00,Odd
2109,2019-07-22 01:32:16+00:00,New @Hyperloop top speed of 463 km/h!!
2110,2019-07-21 23:07:02+00:00,Just saw that on a T-shirt @Hyperloop competition 
2111,2019-07-21 23:05:20+00:00,"Technically, alcohol is a solution"
2112,2019-07-21 09:17:40+00:00,"Full stack is 41 rn, but kinda beggin for just one more …"
2113,2019-07-21 09:16:36+00:00,Way too long
2114,2019-07-21 08:11:36+00:00,Starship Super Heavy with 35 Raptors
2115,2019-07-21 05:01:40+00:00,I have the t-shirt
2116,2019-07-20 01:14:38+00:00,Won’t change. Starship launch structure will be attached to the other side from tower.
2117,2019-07-20 00:29:38+00:00,Starship launch structure is being built off-site in steel subsections
2118,2019-07-20 00:05:55+00:00,2 to 3 months after that
2119,2019-07-20 00:04:31+00:00,It *is* vision
2120,2019-07-20 00:00:54+00:00,I suspect many besides SpaceX will livestream these flights. Won’t be subtle.
2121,2019-07-19 23:58:16+00:00,Texas and Florida Starship prototypes (not Hopper) fly in 2 to 3 months
2122,2019-07-19 19:45:42+00:00,Made with rain 
2123,2019-07-19 15:37:59+00:00,Coming soon
2124,2019-07-19 04:21:07+00:00,Yes
2125,2019-07-19 03:55:20+00:00,Tesla Service Centers & Superchargers are being opened as fast as possible across Eastern Europe
2126,2019-07-18 21:28:15+00:00,"This is actually a good thing btw. China is making amazing progress in space, rapidly iterating on rocket & space station technology. Great respect."
2127,2019-07-18 21:20:56+00:00,"No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot"
2128,2019-07-18 21:17:01+00:00,"Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as you’d expect."
2129,2019-07-18 21:14:26+00:00,Maybe end of next year
2130,2019-07-18 20:46:49+00:00,Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more near-term applications
2131,2019-07-18 20:24:06+00:00,"Post test fuel leak, but no major damage"
2132,2019-07-18 20:22:59+00:00,Aiming for hover test next week
2133,2019-07-18 20:22:33+00:00,"Yeah, big advantage of being made of high strength stainless steel: not bothered by a little heat!"
2134,2019-07-18 20:18:27+00:00,"This non-Autopilot graph is not correct, as it includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features"
2135,2019-07-18 19:12:02+00:00,Good piece
2136,2019-07-18 18:58:25+00:00,I mostly drive Model S Performance with dev version of FSD computer. Our new Raven powertain & adaptive damping suspension is great! Next is Model 3P & then X if driving with my kids. Acceleration is fun on tap!
2137,2019-07-18 18:34:44+00:00,"Exactly. There is no “MSRP”, only “P”."
2138,2019-07-18 18:01:15+00:00, 
2139,2019-07-18 00:32:26+00:00,With anything online
2140,2019-07-18 00:29:17+00:00,Rococo Basilisk
2141,2019-07-17 21:21:54+00:00," yes, security is extremely important"
2142,2019-07-17 20:22:48+00:00,Sure
2143,2019-07-17 20:04:05+00:00,"Thoughtful analysis. We will endeavor to provide the robots, chips & software to academia."
2144,2019-07-17 19:46:12+00:00,
2145,2019-07-17 19:41:31+00:00,Neuralink surprise twist!
2146,2019-07-17 18:56:23+00:00,Is there a longer edit I can post?
2147,2019-07-17 08:38:59+00:00,I think so
2148,2019-07-17 08:10:28+00:00,"Something like this is the best way to do it. Incent outcome, not path."
2149,2019-07-17 03:45:49+00:00,About to go live
2150,2019-07-17 03:39:47+00:00,Not easy getting a lightsaber into backpack
2151,2019-07-17 01:18:47+00:00,Approximately 6.9km/s
2152,2019-07-17 00:59:07+00:00, SpaceX has Area 59 
2153,2019-07-17 00:50:00+00:00,"Agreed, should be $3k less to get to FSD from EAP"
2154,2019-07-16 19:32:27+00:00,"“If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.” — Gen Shinseki"
2155,2019-07-16 17:23:49+00:00,"As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit."
2156,2019-07-16 16:55:58+00:00,Probably
2157,2019-07-16 16:54:31+00:00,Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
2158,2019-07-16 16:51:36+00:00,Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
2159,2019-07-16 16:35:05+00:00,"Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them & we won’t be able to."
2160,2019-07-16 16:25:59+00:00,"No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers"
2161,2019-07-16 16:14:29+00:00,"If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week"
2162,2019-07-16 15:39:12+00:00,Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.
2163,2019-07-16 15:37:05+00:00,Presentation streaming live from http://Neuralink.com at 8pm Pacific
2164,2019-07-16 15:33:57+00:00,Streaming. Check Neuralink website later today. Starts around 8pm.
2165,2019-07-16 15:31:06+00:00,"Won’t be today, hopefully tomorrow"
2166,2019-07-16 15:27:34+00:00,"Sure, will do"
2167,2019-07-16 15:17:40+00:00,"This guy is not a cofounder of Neuralink. Was at company briefly, but he didn’t work out."

2175,2019-07-13 19:05:56+00:00,Haha yes
2176,2019-07-13 19:05:33+00:00,"Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers."
2177,2019-07-13 19:04:28+00:00,"Yeah, that’s next after summon"
2178,2019-07-13 19:03:22+00:00,"Will trace back inertial measurements & wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off"
2179,2019-07-13 18:55:57+00:00,"Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year"
2180,2019-07-13 18:47:14+00:00,Probably 5mph or 8 km/h
2181,2019-07-13 18:43:49+00:00,Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
2182,2019-07-13 18:42:11+00:00,Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
2183,2019-07-13 18:40:11+00:00,"Agreed, it’s a small, but important, feature"
2184,2019-07-13 17:17:27+00:00,Ok

2188,2019-07-12 07:35:37+00:00,"About right, but dangerously chuggy & risking bad things at 40%. We’ll keep it above 50% for this flight."
2189,2019-07-12 07:31:41+00:00,"More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin θ/2, as I recall, but doesn’t matter, as there’s no geo anywhere near that mass."

2217,2019-07-09 17:31:04+00:00,True
2218,2019-07-09 06:39:26+00:00,Exactly

2221,2019-07-09 04:08:09+00:00,"There is no “refreshed” Model X or Model S coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes. Most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency Model 3 rear drive unit as S/X front drive unit. That went into production 3 months ago."

2227,2019-07-08 06:31:30+00:00,"Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio, but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions, so not surprising."
2228,2019-07-08 05:58:17+00:00,Exactly
2229,2019-07-08 05:55:12+00:00,Sure 
2230,2019-07-08 05:49:48+00:00,"To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car"
2231,2019-07-08 05:35:04+00:00,"Between first development engine & first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware & software. Over time, thousands."
2232,2019-07-08 05:08:07+00:00,Upgrading to 250kW soon
2233,2019-07-08 03:58:56+00:00,"Intersections with complex traffic lights & shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety."

2235,2019-07-08 03:36:03+00:00,Yes

2237,2019-07-08 03:34:09+00:00,"End of Q4, most likely"
2238,2019-07-08 03:31:08+00:00,"Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4, as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies."
2239,2019-07-08 03:24:02+00:00,This is why it’s possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k & make at least ~500k FSD cars

2277,2019-06-30 02:23:29+00:00,"FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years."
2278,2019-06-30 01:57:17+00:00,"Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less & convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines"
2279,2019-06-29 23:41:11+00:00,"Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves."

2291,2019-06-28 02:37:33+00:00, 
2292,2019-06-28 02:06:37+00:00,"But, if you’re going to buy a merkin, be sure to haggle properly!"
2293,2019-06-28 01:59:45+00:00,"If you don’t already know what a merkin is, don’t google it. You have been warned."
2294,2019-06-28 01:37:24+00:00,Typing Merlin literally just autocorrected me to merkin 
2295,2019-06-27 19:59:00+00:00,"We poured our heart & soul into it. Lot of hubris too, but no regrets. Fabergé egg of cars."

2297,2019-06-27 19:53:34+00:00,We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
2298,2019-06-27 19:48:38+00:00,Design & production of The Spirit of St Louis was so incredible https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_St._Louis
2299,2019-06-27 13:49:53+00:00,2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
2300,2019-06-27 02:29:01+00:00,That’s actually kinda true
2301,2019-06-26 22:21:26+00:00,Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower & Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
2302,2019-06-26 22:15:14+00:00,You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
2303,2019-06-26 22:12:04+00:00,"That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent."
2304,2019-06-26 22:07:36+00:00,"~1000, as all seats would be “coach” & no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands."
2305,2019-06-26 21:59:09+00:00,"About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
2306,2019-06-26 21:51:09+00:00,"That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher & stability of booster in ground winds is low"
2307,2019-06-26 21:32:46+00:00,There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
2308,2019-06-26 21:31:25+00:00,"Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible."
2309,2019-06-26 21:26:02+00:00,"Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work."
2310,2019-06-26 20:53:08+00:00,Probably sooner
2311,2019-06-26 20:50:55+00:00,Ok
2312,2019-06-26 05:21:14+00:00,"Sure, that would be an honor"
2313,2019-06-26 01:22:11+00:00,Most likely. It is programmed to do so.

2319,2019-06-26 01:05:05+00:00,"Yes, but we couldn’t take a chance on 2nd stage failing it’s 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I’m aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well."
2320,2019-06-25 08:21:34+00:00,Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
2321,2019-06-25 07:19:51+00:00,High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
2322,2019-06-25 07:12:12+00:00,Center core RUD. It was a long shot.

2346,2019-06-24 17:36:25+00:00,"All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox & fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness & needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms "
2347,2019-06-24 17:22:26+00:00,It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
2348,2019-06-24 17:20:04+00:00,"Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock & strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
2349,2019-06-24 16:37:08+00:00,"Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
2350,2019-06-24 16:33:29+00:00,Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals & bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
2351,2019-06-24 13:00:01+00:00,So cool

2355,2019-06-24 12:07:59+00:00,"Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy & immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps."

2359,2019-06-24 06:26:02+00:00,"Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level"
2360,2019-06-24 06:16:56+00:00,"Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1."

2365,2019-06-24 05:06:49+00:00,"Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year."
2366,2019-06-24 04:54:31+00:00,"Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design & replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year."

2510,2019-05-28 01:44:12+00:00,True. I’m a gamer & my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
2511,2019-05-28 00:43:21+00:00,Yup
2512,2019-05-27 07:18:28+00:00,Would love to do exactly that
2513,2019-05-27 07:17:34+00:00,"Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits & arrays are tracking to sun."
2514,2019-05-27 07:11:41+00:00,"Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science."
2515,2019-05-27 07:07:09+00:00,Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
2516,2019-05-27 07:05:34+00:00,"Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy."
2517,2019-05-27 06:58:36+00:00,"Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers"
2518,2019-05-27 06:52:28+00:00,"If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris"
2519,2019-05-27 06:32:24+00:00,"There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully & will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible."
2520,2019-05-27 06:20:45+00:00,"No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency."
2521,2019-05-26 02:50:25+00:00,Fair
2522,2019-05-25 23:31:30+00:00,Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy & internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
2523,2019-05-25 22:06:05+00:00,Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites & allow some amount of yaw steering.
2524,2019-05-25 20:56:09+00:00,"Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars."
2525,2019-05-25 20:44:30+00:00,"Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density & thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp & up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum."
2526,2019-05-25 19:57:54+00:00,Whoa cool 
2527,2019-05-25 19:31:25+00:00,Yes
2528,2019-05-25 17:45:50+00:00,Beautiful solar sail
2529,2019-05-25 17:06:14+00:00,ISS is extremely gigantic & has lights
2530,2019-05-25 16:46:00+00:00,"Precisely, sats will be in darkness when stars are visible"
2531,2019-05-25 16:39:35+00:00,Exactly
2532,2019-05-25 11:07:36+00:00,Karma 
2533,2019-05-25 09:50:58+00:00,Bold move
2534,2019-05-25 09:41:54+00:00,“Stop sending me this étron” - Audi
2535,2019-05-25 09:34:06+00:00,Great ad
2536,2019-05-25 08:16:07+00:00,This is complete nonsense
2537,2019-05-25 07:52:55+00:00,Exactly. A car being electric & upgradable to full self-driving maximizes future resale value.
2538,2019-05-25 07:26:03+00:00,It’s not my finest work 
2539,2019-05-25 07:23:15+00:00,"Given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine cars, their future resale value cars will be low. Consumers are starting to realize this."
2540,2019-05-25 07:17:49+00:00, &amp; 
2541,2019-05-25 07:14:54+00:00, 
2542,2019-05-25 00:19:49+00:00,"Krypton thrusters operative, satellites initiating orbit raise every 90 mins"
2543,2019-05-24 21:28:04+00:00,No
2544,2019-05-24 21:12:56+00:00, Absolutely
2545,2019-05-24 21:00:06+00:00,"Yes, 3 to 6 months"
2546,2019-05-24 20:50:13+00:00,Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected
2547,2019-05-24 20:45:35+00:00,Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
2548,2019-05-24 20:44:59+00:00,Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps & elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
2549,2019-05-24 20:35:32+00:00,"Opposite is true: you can have 100’s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below"
2550,2019-05-24 20:30:14+00:00,"Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly & directly that it doesn’t matter"
2551,2019-05-24 20:24:16+00:00,"Exactly. Still, pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed!"
2552,2019-05-24 20:20:34+00:00,Paperwork & hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
2553,2019-05-24 20:17:53+00:00,"LA has a subway, but most people don’t know about it"
2554,2019-05-24 20:17:22+00:00,That would great!
2555,2019-05-24 20:15:45+00:00,Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. It’s optional!

2557,2019-05-24 20:07:13+00:00,"So far, so good"
2558,2019-05-24 20:04:20+00:00,"Ironically, same publications will attack me for compensation tied to Tesla tripling in value and imply Tesla is worthless. They can’t *both* be true!"
2559,2019-05-24 19:59:06+00:00,Gary the still crushes us! Wouldn’t be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
2560,2019-05-24 19:53:55+00:00,Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.
2561,2019-05-24 07:45:32+00:00,This is simple and just works
2562,2019-05-24 06:44:45+00:00,Pretty much
2563,2019-05-24 06:35:34+00:00,Racing at 127mph in a tunnel under LA

2565,2019-05-24 04:42:47+00:00,Krypton ion thrusters activate in about 3 hours to raise orbit
2566,2019-05-24 04:41:12+00:00,"All 60 Starlink satellites online, solar array deployment coming up soon"
2567,2019-05-24 04:24:29+00:00,"Thanks! Yeah, that’s pretty close."
2568,2019-05-24 02:27:34+00:00,Launch in 3 mins
2569,2019-05-24 02:25:49+00:00,"New S & X are much improved. Worth trying out. You’re on version 2, current S/X is version 4."
2570,2019-05-24 02:22:35+00:00,It’s smart *and* enhanced!
2571,2019-05-24 02:20:34+00:00,Smart Summon coming soon!
2572,2019-05-23 22:23:13+00:00,"Tower with Knight is across road from SpaceX, looking at rocket"
2573,2019-05-23 22:20:18+00:00,"Part of the factory is being upgraded, but tours will continue around the parts that aren’t"
2574,2019-05-23 21:42:06+00:00,"Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full."
2575,2019-05-23 21:38:38+00:00,Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
2576,2019-05-23 21:20:00+00:00,~2.8m
2577,2019-05-23 19:59:42+00:00,"Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have 3 fan-looking things on pump side & complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber."
2578,2019-05-23 18:18:13+00:00,Horizontally
2579,2019-05-23 18:17:33+00:00,"First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around 20."
2580,2019-05-23 18:16:29+00:00,So it goes
2581,2019-05-23 18:13:51+00:00,3 months
2582,2019-05-23 18:09:53+00:00,"Hopefully, 4 months"
2583,2019-05-23 18:04:47+00:00,Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly & at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move & increases moment of inertia.
2584,2019-05-23 18:00:43+00:00,"Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees"
2585,2019-05-23 06:32:36+00:00,
2586,2019-05-23 06:28:07+00:00,Sure
2587,2019-05-23 06:23:13+00:00,Two tunnels about a mile long each
2588,2019-05-23 06:14:09+00:00,Yes
2589,2019-05-23 06:12:14+00:00,"Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, you’d have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!"
2590,2019-05-23 06:07:26+00:00,"Aiming for 150 tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least 100 tons, allowing for mass growth"
2591,2019-05-23 06:04:32+00:00,N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces & high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
2592,2019-05-23 05:56:08+00:00,"Hoping for 380 sec Isp, but at least 370. Otherwise similar to sea level version."
2593,2019-05-23 05:52:36+00:00,Aspirationally
2594,2019-05-23 05:34:59+00:00,"3 sea level optimized Raptors, 3 vacuum optimized Raptors (big nozzle)"
2595,2019-05-23 05:20:32+00:00,"After the GoT finale, we dropped it to 6"
2596,2019-05-23 05:18:42+00:00,"Mk1 & Mk2 ships at Boca & Cape will fly with at least 3 engines, maybe all 6"
2597,2019-05-23 05:08:34+00:00,"About to complete SN5, ramping to an engine every 3 days this summer"
2598,2019-05-23 01:36:43+00:00,Boring Company starts digging Vegas tunnel in 2 months. Aiming to finish by end of year.
2599,2019-05-23 00:03:10+00:00,"The turbine also spins though. Partially combusted gas drives the turbine wheel, which is attached to a shaft that turns the inducer & impellers."
2600,2019-05-22 23:59:02+00:00,"But, essentially, the spinning things"
2601,2019-05-22 23:48:53+00:00,Yes
2602,2019-05-22 23:46:51+00:00,"Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer & 2 impellers with ~100,000 shaft horsepower."
2603,2019-05-22 19:30:14+00:00, 
2604,2019-05-22 18:00:04+00:00,Did it for the memes
2605,2019-05-22 16:42:02+00:00,Coming soon
2606,2019-05-21 22:41:14+00:00,"Yeah, been thinking about it for a long time. Electric supersonic VTOL. Hard problem."
2607,2019-05-21 22:28:56+00:00,Hopefully in about 10 days
2608,2019-05-21 22:27:25+00:00,Physics favors full flow
2609,2019-05-21 22:24:17+00:00,Good design imo
2610,2019-05-21 21:56:48+00:00,Thanks Sam!
2611,2019-05-21 15:57:04+00:00,Good piece on lower total cost of ownership of electric vehicles
2612,2019-05-19 20:04:38+00:00,Sorry to hear that. Will fix.
2613,2019-05-19 12:09:21+00:00,Ok
2614,2019-05-19 10:39:13+00:00,Easy to turn one of our Starlink satellites into a debris collector
2615,2019-05-19 10:35:19+00:00,Yes
2616,2019-05-19 05:58:12+00:00,Almost ready. I’m testing it personally this weekend.
2617,2019-05-19 02:43:51+00:00,Yes
2618,2019-05-19 02:42:09+00:00,Also porting Unreal Engine
2619,2019-05-19 01:46:03+00:00,Nintendo won’t let us
2620,2019-05-19 01:42:43+00:00,"Maybe so eventually, but it will be information & entertainment, not trickery"
2621,2019-05-19 01:39:07+00:00,"Tesla does not advertise or pay for endorsements. Instead, we use that money to make the product great."
2622,2019-05-19 01:29:19+00:00,We def need racing game using actual car steering wheel & pedals!
2623,2019-05-19 01:28:03+00:00,Sure
2624,2019-05-19 01:27:40+00:00,Of course
2625,2019-05-19 01:27:03+00:00,Portal 1 & 2 on this would rock
2626,2019-05-19 01:26:22+00:00,Would be great to have @Roblox &amp; @Minecraft!
2627,2019-05-19 01:25:35+00:00,"Interact with games via touchscreen, steering wheel buttons & XBox/PS controllers"
2628,2019-05-18 23:15:21+00:00,Lots more games coming once we finish porting Unity!
2629,2019-05-18 19:48:16+00:00,Top Secret
2630,2019-05-18 06:05:32+00:00,"It technically could, but wouldn’t have enough mass margin for a heat shield, landing propellant or legs, so not reusable"
2631,2019-05-18 05:39:53+00:00,"No worse than production of a gasoline car, provided the lithium-ion battery cathode is primarily nickel vs cobalt. Nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless steel, which is what knives & forks are made of."
2632,2019-05-18 05:25:50+00:00,
2633,2019-05-18 05:23:44+00:00,"Because a Tesla produces no emissions & filters most toxins, pollen, spores & viruses, it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels"
2634,2019-05-17 18:54:43+00:00,Sure is. I live here. Air quality is especially bad near highways.
2635,2019-05-17 18:50:10+00:00,This is why we put extra filters in all Tesla cars. S & X even have hospital operating room grade HEPA filters.
2636,2019-05-17 18:47:29+00:00, 
2637,2019-05-17 18:32:50+00:00,"Yeah, feels like something is messed up with Apple news app. Almost only ever shows negative news. Nickname is “the hate stream” "
2638,2019-05-17 18:00:56+00:00,Congrats on many successful launches!
2639,2019-05-17 06:37:56+00:00,And I am forever grateful
2640,2019-05-16 19:16:50+00:00,√-1 2^3 3.14 
2641,2019-05-16 19:05:57+00:00,Set of all math jokes that are actually funny is pretty small (sigh)
2642,2019-05-16 19:03:24+00:00,"Physics demands the impedance of resistance, because it’s not real"
2643,2019-05-16 18:58:50+00:00,What makes resistance complex is that it’s half imaginary!
2644,2019-05-16 18:04:25+00:00,Glad it worked out
2645,2019-05-16 17:55:33+00:00,Congratulations @kitkitschool &amp; @onebillion on creating great open source literacy software!
2646,2019-05-16 01:52:53+00:00,"6 more launches of 60 for initial activation, 12 for significant coverage"
2647,2019-05-16 01:26:39+00:00,"Starlink mission will be heaviest @SpaceX payload ever at 18.5 tons. If all goes well, each launch of 60 satellites will generate more power than Space Station &amp; deliver 1 terabit of bandwidth to Earth."
2648,2019-05-15 16:26:41+00:00, 
2649,2019-05-15 00:03:43+00:00,That’s about right
2650,2019-05-15 00:02:26+00:00,Probably start installing end of next month
2651,2019-05-15 00:00:46+00:00,"SN4 is done. Hawthorne is working on SN5 now, but focus is ramping build rate of SN6 through SN10."
2652,2019-05-14 23:57:30+00:00,"The opposite. Any insights gained by one team must be shared with the other, but other team not required to use them."
2653,2019-05-14 23:55:34+00:00,Both sites will make many Starships. This is a competition to see which location is most effective. Answer might be both.
2654,2019-05-14 23:53:37+00:00,SpaceX is doing simultaneous competing builds of Starship in Boca Chica Texas & Cape Canaveral Florida
2655,2019-05-14 08:52:36+00:00,"A lot, but you can’t count on lines"
2656,2019-05-13 15:59:03+00:00,Exactly
2657,2019-05-13 07:12:22+00:00,It’s a factor
2658,2019-05-13 06:59:20+00:00,GoT season finale leaked
2659,2019-05-13 06:04:28+00:00,"Technically, his bro"
2660,2019-05-13 06:02:51+00:00,
2661,2019-05-12 16:35:36+00:00,Happy Mother’s Day. I love you Mom!
2662,2019-05-12 12:20:29+00:00,Ok
2663,2019-05-12 03:32:31+00:00,Completely agree. Every Tesla should have good art & music creation software.
2664,2019-05-12 03:02:08+00:00,It is flat-packed. No dispenser.
2665,2019-05-12 01:59:13+00:00,That *might* not be my lucky number
2666,2019-05-12 01:55:19+00:00,"More details on day of launch, currently tracking to Wednesday"
2667,2019-05-12 01:54:33+00:00,"Much will likely go wrong on 1st mission. Also, 6 more launches of 60 sats needed for minor coverage, 12 for moderate."
2668,2019-05-12 01:50:44+00:00,"These are production design, unlike our earlier Tintin demo sats"
2669,2019-05-12 01:48:14+00:00,"If static fire on Mon, on Tues"
2670,2019-05-12 01:43:39+00:00,First 60 @SpaceX Starlink satellites loaded into Falcon fairing. Tight fit.
2671,2019-05-12 00:43:18+00:00,Ok
2672,2019-05-11 18:20:09+00:00, u3k
2673,2019-05-11 04:41:22+00:00,Exactly
2674,2019-05-11 04:27:05+00:00,Yes

2854,2019-04-23 21:09:42+00:00,"Those who predicted Tesla & EVs would be dead & autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?"
2855,2019-04-23 20:59:18+00:00,Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars & autonomy was between 10 years & never …

2857,2019-04-23 19:03:07+00:00,"Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) & we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year."
2858,2019-04-23 19:00:36+00:00,"As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost & larger range pack needed."

2867,2019-04-23 04:59:05+00:00,"Exactly. Also, you can’t actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds."

2940,2019-04-15 03:55:18+00:00,Buying a car in 2019 that can’t upgrade to full self-driving is like buying a horse instead of a car in 1919

2958,2019-04-14 20:42:39+00:00,Exactly
2959,2019-04-14 20:36:10+00:00,How embarrassing. Will change.
2960,2019-04-14 20:33:46+00:00,We will. You read it right.
2961,2019-04-14 20:31:17+00:00,Haha true
2962,2019-04-14 20:07:13+00:00,I’ve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport & energy
2963,2019-04-14 20:03:48+00:00,"Good point, small oil is a problem too"
2964,2019-04-14 20:00:31+00:00,"I’m sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil, coal & gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels …"
2965,2019-04-14 19:55:04+00:00,"Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false."
2966,2019-04-14 19:36:50+00:00,"True, Bloomberg is almost as bad"
2967,2019-04-14 19:30:35+00:00,Holman Jenkins & WSJ in general are sock puppets of big oil
2968,2019-04-14 19:29:00+00:00,Starship is kinda Gundam
2969,2019-04-14 19:28:11+00:00,"Very much so. There are 2.5B cars & trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -> demand >> supply."
2970,2019-04-14 19:19:19+00:00,"Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn’t have access to the video unless sent to us by owner."

2975,2019-04-14 08:58:12+00:00,"Wow, a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve."
2976,2019-04-14 08:42:08+00:00,"There is 35 GWh/yr “theoretical capacity”, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3’s in Q1 due to cell constraints."
2977,2019-04-13 20:32:25+00:00,Yes
2978,2019-04-13 19:59:02+00:00,"Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date"
2979,2019-04-13 19:56:42+00:00,"Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn’t cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability"
2980,2019-04-13 19:43:17+00:00,Yes
2981,2019-04-13 19:41:42+00:00,"There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase"
2982,2019-04-13 19:40:50+00:00,"Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later."
2983,2019-04-13 19:19:30+00:00,Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
2984,2019-04-13 19:17:46+00:00,Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr & have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
2985,2019-04-13 17:33:19+00:00,Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
2986,2019-04-13 17:31:46+00:00,Something like that
2987,2019-04-13 17:29:59+00:00,Starting May 1
2988,2019-04-13 17:26:58+00:00,Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time

2992,2019-04-13 16:18:56+00:00,Model 3 drive unit & body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last 300k to 500k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.
2993,2019-04-13 16:05:56+00:00,Cool

3022,2019-04-10 21:37:49+00:00,Probably something notable to announce in a few months

3097,2019-04-03 22:50:50+00:00,Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower & allow below current “0%” level. Making that adjustment too.
3098,2019-04-03 22:41:21+00:00,Agreed
3099,2019-04-03 22:38:53+00:00,Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.

3229,2019-03-17 19:52:33+00:00,"Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed."
3230,2019-03-17 19:44:03+00:00,"Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout …"
3231,2019-03-17 19:40:45+00:00,"Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine & stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely."
3232,2019-03-17 19:37:32+00:00,First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.

3240,2019-03-16 21:02:35+00:00,"This causes some media confusion, as batch builds & ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month & terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules."
3241,2019-03-16 20:53:52+00:00,"Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations & we try to build in batches to simplify production"

3245,2019-03-16 20:05:14+00:00,"Still get this question a lot, even though Norway has highest Tesla cars per person on (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice."

3276,2019-03-12 05:08:49+00:00,"However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak"
3277,2019-03-12 05:07:38+00:00,"We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference — about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team & board."
3278,2019-03-12 05:03:42+00:00,"When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don’t want to write Tesla a check. So it goes."

3311,2019-03-07 22:24:01+00:00,"Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case & more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput."

3354,2019-03-03 06:01:03+00:00, 
3355,2019-03-03 05:56:53+00:00,Everyone knows Earth is hollow
3356,2019-03-03 05:24:26+00:00,I am not a dog. Here’s a pic of me:
3357,2019-03-03 04:58:51+00:00,Model S will be raised to 162mph too
3358,2019-03-03 04:57:01+00:00,Thank you. May you have good luck and godspeed with your spacecraft!
3359,2019-03-03 01:33:27+00:00,"Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. Also, thank you to @NASA, without whom this would not be possible."
3360,2019-03-02 23:40:02+00:00,Power will increase on all cars. Top speed on 3P increases to 162mph. Range on RWD 3 increases to 325 miles.
3361,2019-03-02 23:22:11+00:00,"Yes, new cars and existing fleet"
3362,2019-03-02 23:03:15+00:00,Firmware update coming later this month will increase power by ~5% & top speed by 10 km/h or 7mph
3363,2019-03-02 22:33:45+00:00,Spoiler alert: not Porsche
3364,2019-03-02 19:33:32+00:00,Thank you on behalf of the many people of SpaceX
3365,2019-03-02 19:10:12+00:00,Lightning bolt right before launch
3366,2019-03-02 10:22:20+00:00,Earth floats gently in zero gravity
3367,2019-03-02 08:46:46+00:00,SpaceX Crew Dragon recap
3368,2019-03-02 07:22:10+00:00,Need to get back to SpaceX launch control. Sorry this solution isn’t perfect.
3369,2019-03-02 07:15:21+00:00,"We’re trying to make EVs & autonomy more affordable over time. This is the right thing to do. However, we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the company."
3370,2019-03-02 07:09:09+00:00,Will take a few days for system update
3371,2019-03-02 06:58:25+00:00,"Yeah, we need a few days to update the system. If anyone already paid $3k, they should get $1k back."
3372,2019-03-02 06:55:49+00:00,"It’s not exactly symmetric, but it will come with HW3 upgrade long-term"
3373,2019-03-02 06:36:51+00:00,"If you bought enhanced autopilot, FSD upgrade costs $2k instead of $5k"
3374,2019-03-02 06:01:35+00:00,"If you bought a Tesla before yesterday’s price reduction, you can have Autopilot or full self-driving at half normal cost (up to $6k less)"
3375,2019-03-02 04:53:05+00:00,He is the sensor!
3376,2019-03-02 04:34:52+00:00,"Nope, he’s going to float around in zero gravity"
3377,2019-03-02 04:31:33+00:00,Super high tech zero-g indicator added just before launch!
3378,2019-03-02 00:52:02+00:00,Happy birthday!
3379,2019-03-01 18:24:38+00:00,"Yeah, just use a dryer outlet. High power, easy to install & low cost."
3380,2019-03-01 18:21:01+00:00,Explanation from Tesla later today
3381,2019-03-01 07:12:10+00:00,Yes
3382,2019-03-01 06:49:49+00:00,Haha
3383,2019-03-01 06:37:35+00:00,Ripley
3384,2019-03-01 03:07:07+00:00,"Base Model 3 available in Europe in ~6 months, Asia 6 to 8 months. Latter contingent on Shanghai Gigafactory. Country-specific taxes & import duties mean price may be 25% or more above US number."
3385,2019-03-01 01:54:20+00:00,Exactly
3386,2019-03-01 01:34:49+00:00,No reductions from here
3387,2019-03-01 01:33:19+00:00,For sure. It fundamentally improves quality of life.
3388,2019-03-01 01:31:05+00:00,Best choice for most people is standard range plus with Autopilot
3389,2019-03-01 01:14:41+00:00,Exact Tesla Model 3 in my profile pic costs $35k before incentives & takes 1 minute to buy online at
3390,2019-02-28 23:16:26+00:00,I think we should do something here. Will talk with team & send out a note in next few days.
3391,2019-02-28 23:14:16+00:00,Should be ~5% peak power increase with March 15 software release
3392,2019-02-28 23:03:27+00:00,"Scheduled for March 15 release, along with many other improvements"
3393,2019-02-28 23:01:50+00:00,"Everyone who bought Enhanced Autopilot will get Navigate on Autopilot on highways, advanced summon & autopark"
3394,2019-02-28 03:41:32+00:00, 
3395,2019-02-27 20:44:31+00:00,I was being too obvious
3396,2019-02-27 20:43:51+00:00,Make the Mars Technocracy real
3397,2019-02-27 20:37:25+00:00,Yay!
3398,2019-02-27 20:00:32+00:00,ET phone home. No answer 
3399,2019-02-27 08:21:53+00:00,Some Tesla news
3400,2019-02-27 07:48:42+00:00,Haha
3401,2019-02-27 07:43:45+00:00,Yes
3402,2019-02-27 07:31:31+00:00,Stop censoring science!
3403,2019-02-27 07:01:05+00:00,Because it costs $2500 to transport to east coast & everyone pays same
3404,2019-02-27 06:44:28+00:00,California
3405,2019-02-27 06:40:37+00:00,Thursday 2pm
3406,2019-02-26 20:34:13+00:00,"Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It’s 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder."
3407,2019-02-26 13:38:28+00:00,"Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel."
3408,2019-02-26 13:35:38+00:00,"Yes, exciting potential"
3409,2019-02-26 13:33:24+00:00,Exactly
3410,2019-02-26 12:36:50+00:00,"Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can’t print yet."
3411,2019-02-26 12:25:14+00:00,Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
3412,2019-02-26 12:22:12+00:00,"Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco & other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceX’s success. Great respect & appreciation!"
3413,2019-02-26 05:06:56+00:00,"Thank you Evelyn, I loved it"
3414,2019-02-26 02:13:05+00:00,"Indeed. I have great respect for judges. It’s not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system."
3415,2019-02-26 02:08:26+00:00,"SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing … "
3416,2019-02-26 00:02:37+00:00,Oh hi lol
3417,2019-02-25 21:48:50+00:00,"Fate *loves* irony. Frankly, too much."
3418,2019-02-25 20:43:13+00:00,Meetings are a valuable use of time!
3419,2019-02-25 18:57:37+00:00,There’s a in my

3422,2019-02-22 23:16:41+00:00,Great meme review hosted by Will Smith
3423,2019-02-22 17:06:11+00:00,Haha true
3424,2019-02-22 02:42:43+00:00,It’s designed to be way better. We’ll see what reality has to say about that.
3425,2019-02-22 02:41:59+00:00,"Yes, lot of risk"
3426,2019-02-22 02:41:24+00:00,"Guys, I have feelings … "
3427,2019-02-22 02:39:44+00:00,Focusing on Starship instead
3428,2019-02-22 02:38:04+00:00,Deorbits & burns up over the Pacific
3429,2019-02-22 02:37:21+00:00,"Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads & Dragon abort thrusters."
3430,2019-02-22 02:35:37+00:00,"Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so"
3431,2019-02-22 02:34:15+00:00,"Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big."
3432,2019-02-22 02:28:42+00:00,"High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life."
3433,2019-02-22 02:15:54+00:00,Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
3434,2019-02-22 02:14:37+00:00,Yes 
3435,2019-02-22 02:13:04+00:00,Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April.
3436,2019-02-21 18:59:58+00:00,Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
3437,2019-02-21 18:58:30+00:00,"Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight."
3438,2019-02-21 18:52:59+00:00,SN2 has changes that should help
3439,2019-02-21 18:42:33+00:00,To the first part. I doubt we’d create a Dyson ring or sphere.
3440,2019-02-21 18:41:53+00:00,Yes
3441,2019-02-21 18:41:25+00:00,"Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done."
3442,2019-02-21 18:35:40+00:00,"Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun."
3443,2019-02-21 18:32:17+00:00,"Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space."
3444,2019-02-21 18:06:20+00:00,You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
3445,2019-02-21 18:05:25+00:00,Pinter injector tends to have hot & cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
3446,2019-02-21 17:53:26+00:00,"Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars."
3447,2019-02-21 17:51:08+00:00,"We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done"
3448,2019-02-21 17:48:18+00:00,"Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
3449,2019-02-21 17:39:27+00:00,"That’s true Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there."
3450,2019-02-21 16:41:40+00:00,"Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."
3451,2019-02-21 16:37:01+00:00,Don’t know
3452,2019-02-21 16:25:44+00:00,"SpaceX commercial launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years."
3453,2019-02-21 16:11:12+00:00,"Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
3454,2019-02-21 16:02:41+00:00,"SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight & thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."
3455,2019-02-21 11:05:24+00:00,So true John Clarke 
3456,2019-02-21 10:54:45+00:00,"Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure & temperature in oxygen preburner"
3457,2019-02-21 10:50:48+00:00,Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
3458,2019-02-21 10:44:32+00:00,"That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don’t have any crypto holdings."
3459,2019-02-21 10:40:20+00:00,"I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1. Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes."
3460,2019-02-20 04:41:03+00:00,"Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k."
3461,2019-02-20 00:17:02+00:00,Won’t be long before they do
3462,2019-02-20 00:15:41+00:00,"Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019"
3463,2019-02-20 00:02:34+00:00,4000 Tesla cars loading in SF for Europe
3464,2019-02-19 03:40:03+00:00,The gritty truth …
3465,2019-02-18 22:04:37+00:00,Did meme review last night with Justin Roiland from @RickandMorty
3466,2019-02-18 18:51:39+00:00,Agreed. Also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown location.
3467,2019-02-17 07:29:47+00:00,Pics are so clear in space!
3468,2019-02-17 07:13:40+00:00,That last bit gives a good sense of what orbit is like
3469,2019-02-17 04:27:28+00:00,"Also, Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI & I didn’t agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do. Add that all up & it was just better to part ways on good terms."
3470,2019-02-17 04:24:41+00:00,I had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering & manufacturing problems at Tesla (especially) & SpaceX
3471,2019-02-17 04:19:27+00:00,"To clarify, I’ve not been involved closely with OpenAI for over a year & don’t have mgmt or board oversight"
3472,2019-02-16 10:46:43+00:00,

3475,2019-02-16 04:33:24+00:00,"Yes, Autopilot max speed is 5mph above speed limit off highway or 90mph on highway"
3476,2019-02-15 01:07:23+00:00,
3477,2019-02-15 01:05:21+00:00,Of course I still love you

3479,2019-02-14 07:49:01+00:00,Yes 
3480,2019-02-14 07:42:15+00:00,"It will start out slow to make sure there are no corner case issues and then, if that looks good, speed up next week. We def need to add a “Request Latest Update” feature!"
3481,2019-02-14 07:37:28+00:00,Updating …
3482,2019-02-14 07:19:42+00:00,"Wow, 2013"
3483,2019-02-14 07:05:40+00:00,CNBC - “Tesla Model 3 ranked most satisfying car”
3484,2019-02-14 06:48:48+00:00,"True, that headline is not exactly going to win a Pulitzer for originality"
3485,2019-02-14 06:13:54+00:00,"Probably a month or two. Sentry mode became top priority, so pushed that out a bit."
3486,2019-02-14 06:12:20+00:00,"Some sites maintained an almost daily Tesla deathwatch 11 years ago, reporting with an awful delight. 4000 days later …"

3489,2019-02-13 07:10:09+00:00,"Yeah, but simpler. Needed for landing burn or engines will suck in a bubble."
3490,2019-02-13 06:44:47+00:00,хаха офигенно
3491,2019-02-13 05:14:44+00:00,"Starship & Super Heavy will press tanks autogenously even in version 1. Very important, as helium costs more than oxygen on Falcon, even though liquid oxygen is 2/3 vehicle mass & helium weighs basically nothing."
3492,2019-02-13 02:12:17+00:00,"Luke, I am your farter."
3493,2019-02-13 02:09:21+00:00,"Thanks Jack, Twitter rocks! "

3495,2019-02-12 05:50:05+00:00,Agreed
3496,2019-02-11 17:04:32+00:00,Sorry Had a vital mission in Norway Now I am back
3497,2019-02-11 06:43:16+00:00,True
3498,2019-02-11 05:55:54+00:00,"Moon first, Mars as soon as the planets align"
3499,2019-02-11 03:56:55+00:00,On my bedside table
3500,2019-02-11 03:55:16+00:00,A biography on Korolev has center place in my study
3501,2019-02-11 03:25:55+00:00,"Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress & setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way, but excitement is guaranteed!"
3502,2019-02-11 03:20:45+00:00,The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship’s success
3503,2019-02-11 03:16:00+00:00,At least 10X cheaper
3504,2019-02-11 03:12:20+00:00,"Very dependent on volume, but I’m confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k & maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth & move to Mars if they want."
3505,2019-02-11 03:03:59+00:00,Yes
3506,2019-02-11 03:02:04+00:00,"This will sound implausible, but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9"
3507,2019-02-11 02:58:21+00:00,Close
3508,2019-02-11 02:57:17+00:00,"But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
3509,2019-02-11 02:55:21+00:00,Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
3510,2019-02-11 02:50:09+00:00,"Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
3511,2019-02-11 02:43:59+00:00,"Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky."
3512,2019-02-11 02:42:40+00:00,I think 6 where we lit main chamber & several with only preburners
3513,2019-02-11 02:40:09+00:00,About 11 secs
3514,2019-02-11 02:29:23+00:00,Definitely! It’s amazing that the RD-170 & RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
3515,2019-02-11 02:19:07+00:00,"Raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by @SpaceX engine/test team!"
3516,2019-02-10 06:20:20+00:00,I was simply too sexy for it
3517,2019-02-09 22:32:47+00:00,Maybe tomorrow

3524,2019-02-08 16:57:55+00:00,"Booster center of mass is much lower & more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry"
3525,2019-02-08 16:45:48+00:00,"Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!"
3526,2019-02-08 16:40:46+00:00,"Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body & maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind."
3527,2019-02-07 22:59:27+00:00,Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
3528,2019-02-07 22:53:18+00:00,"Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles."
3529,2019-02-07 19:52:18+00:00,"The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just “Starship” & sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy"

3539,2019-02-06 07:16:14+00:00,"Exactly. Both prices are shown right next to each other & lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. In fact, for many states in the US, it’s way better."

3573,2019-02-01 06:38:17+00:00,"Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart"
3574,2019-02-01 06:32:55+00:00,"Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher & doesn’t even need paint!"
3575,2019-02-01 02:30:52+00:00,Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
3576,2019-02-01 02:22:46+00:00,Mostly true
3577,2019-02-01 02:21:40+00:00,"Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps & main engines for landing orientation, so won’t need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably."
3578,2019-02-01 02:16:28+00:00,Yes
3579,2019-02-01 02:08:16+00:00,Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship & booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) & sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).

3581,2019-02-01 01:39:12+00:00,Yes. It’s very rare to find all three.
3582,2019-02-01 01:37:05+00:00,"To be clear, I’m confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature & reduced need for heat shielding"
3583,2019-02-01 01:33:47+00:00,"Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9"
3584,2019-02-01 01:31:53+00:00,"Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime & angle of attack"
3585,2019-01-31 22:13:46+00:00,Absolutely. You’ve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.

3674,2019-01-13 21:00:00+00:00,Falcon comes home
3675,2019-01-13 18:59:14+00:00,We are not yet offering the mid range Model 3 in Europe
3676,2019-01-13 18:39:31+00:00,"Which country? There is a 10% import duty, ~20% VAT (US prices don’t include sales tax) and about $2000 in extra shipping cost, but it shouldn’t add up to $25k."
3677,2019-01-13 18:31:23+00:00,View of SpaceX Dragon 1 berthed with @Space_Station in the last Cupola opening. Dragon 2 (Crew Dragon) launching soon.
3678,2019-01-12 21:27:20+00:00,Ok
3679,2019-01-11 10:35:19+00:00,Obv must be more pointy tho
3680,2019-01-11 09:00:32+00:00,It needed to be made real
3681,2019-01-11 04:49:19+00:00,Haha

3684,2019-01-11 04:10:58+00:00,Body/tank diameter is 9m or about 30ft
3685,2019-01-11 04:04:02+00:00,Should be done with first orbital prototype around June
3686,2019-01-11 03:49:06+00:00,Yes

3688,2019-01-11 03:47:22+00:00,Yes
3689,2019-01-11 03:36:32+00:00,"This is for suborbital VTOL tests. Orbital version is taller, has thicker skins (won’t wrinkle) & a smoothly curving nose section."
3690,2019-01-11 03:31:40+00:00,"Starship test flight rocket just finished assembly at the @SpaceX Texas launch site. This is an actual picture, not a rendering."
3691,2019-01-10 06:55:31+00:00,Yes
3692,2019-01-10 06:53:35+00:00,Getting some regulatory pushback. May not be available in all regions.
3693,2019-01-10 06:50:41+00:00,Going through final validation & regulatory approval. Probably releases to early access program owners in a few weeks. It’s trippy!
3694,2019-01-10 06:41:58+00:00,Yes 
3695,2019-01-10 06:40:31+00:00,Tesla *with* Autopilot engaged is twice as safe & continues to make steady improvements
3696,2019-01-09 23:28:50+00:00,Def not
3697,2019-01-09 23:22:43+00:00,Yes
3698,2019-01-09 23:19:32+00:00,"Starting on Monday, Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the 75 kWh version of the Model S & X. If you’d like that version, please order by Sunday night at"
3699,2019-01-09 23:00:19+00:00,Good idea
3700,2019-01-09 22:46:11+00:00,It’s an option
3701,2019-01-09 22:37:32+00:00,Vertically or horizontally?
3702,2019-01-09 22:35:51+00:00,No problem
3703,2019-01-09 22:34:10+00:00,"Plus, you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance"
3704,2019-01-09 22:32:02+00:00,I don’t think the law fully anticipated this situation. So probably yes for a while.
3705,2019-01-09 22:28:57+00:00,I’m not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the 2 rear seats.
3706,2019-01-09 22:04:25+00:00,It will be
3707,2019-01-09 22:02:56+00:00,"Btw, you can buy a Tesla online in less than 2 mins & give it back for a full refund for any reason"

3733,2019-01-05 15:25:58+00:00,Engines currently on Starship hopper are a blend of Raptor development & operational parts. First hopper engine to be fired is almost finished assembly in California. Probably fires next month.
3734,2019-01-05 15:16:27+00:00,Haha

3781,2018-12-27 07:14:14+00:00,I will provide a detailed explanation in March/April
3782,2018-12-27 07:07:55+00:00,Time. Although it also turned out to be dramatically better.
3783,2018-12-27 07:02:20+00:00,Exactly
3784,2018-12-27 06:56:55+00:00,Yes

3790,2018-12-27 03:48:39+00:00,Got it 
3791,2018-12-26 20:23:01+00:00,"Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville & across Mexico."
3792,2018-12-26 20:18:55+00:00,Yep
3793,2018-12-26 20:18:22+00:00,Yes
3794,2018-12-26 20:16:50+00:00,"Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey."
3795,2018-12-26 19:47:21+00:00,"Most people don’t know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China"
3796,2018-12-26 19:40:53+00:00,We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities & working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
3797,2018-12-26 19:38:52+00:00,Ok
3798,2018-12-26 19:37:40+00:00,Wow!
3799,2018-12-26 19:31:08+00:00,"This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car."
3800,2018-12-26 19:23:56+00:00,"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electric_cars_currently_available"
3801,2018-12-26 19:09:28+00:00,"And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements."
3802,2018-12-26 18:57:56+00:00,"There are also many state & local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities & access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc"

3820,2018-12-24 07:34:35+00:00,Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
3821,2018-12-24 07:32:18+00:00,When it’s no longer noticeable over Planck’s length
3822,2018-12-23 23:35:36+00:00,Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth’s gravitational reach is infinite. “Zero gravity” is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.

3828,2018-12-23 05:27:14+00:00,Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities …
3829,2018-12-23 04:44:57+00:00,Please put “invented car fart” on my gravestone. This is my only request.
3830,2018-12-23 03:49:28+00:00,Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
3831,2018-12-23 03:40:58+00:00,"SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for 12000 psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions."

3833,2018-12-22 23:24:16+00:00,"It’s embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
3834,2018-12-22 23:21:59+00:00,"You def don’t want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That’s not a typo."
3835,2018-12-22 23:18:46+00:00,"Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level."
3836,2018-12-22 23:13:27+00:00,Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
3837,2018-12-22 23:06:55+00:00,"Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem."

3839,2018-12-22 23:00:48+00:00,"Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster & orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well & thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons & Mars."

3846,2018-12-22 22:41:02+00:00,"I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we’re building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April"
3847,2018-12-22 22:38:11+00:00,"Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel & we’re using a different alloy mix. I super 300 Series Stainless!"
3848,2018-12-22 22:32:42+00:00,"While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"
3849,2018-12-22 21:47:50+00:00,"Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys & new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized."
3850,2018-12-22 19:05:57+00:00,"If Tesla committed delivery & customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference"
3851,2018-12-22 19:02:28+00:00,Coming soon
3852,2018-12-22 19:01:09+00:00,"It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end"
3853,2018-12-22 18:48:29+00:00,Try connecting to WiFi
3854,2018-12-22 18:45:08+00:00,"Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can’t take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less. Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in 8 days. Order online at http://Tesla.com or visit stores."
3855,2018-12-22 08:02:19+00:00,Only if Dawkins joins
3856,2018-12-22 07:58:12+00:00,Interesting

3864,2018-12-20 16:31:28+00:00,Must feel amazing up there in microgravity zooming around the Earth every 90 minutes! Hope you have a Merry Christmas!
3865,2018-12-20 15:35:30+00:00,"Thanks, will consider next year"
3866,2018-12-20 05:31:18+00:00,"So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this won’t matter for the first few layers"
3867,2018-12-20 02:49:52+00:00,Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in 2 mins with a few taps. No more need to call!

3873,2018-12-19 22:29:06+00:00,"Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference:"
3874,2018-12-19 21:53:22+00:00,Join our underground movement!
3875,2018-12-19 21:50:29+00:00,"Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) & tow or flatbed it out"
3876,2018-12-19 21:47:06+00:00,Ok 
3877,2018-12-19 19:54:01+00:00,Autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. They’re only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
3878,2018-12-19 19:45:10+00:00,Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?
3879,2018-12-19 19:39:59+00:00,Exactly
3880,2018-12-19 19:39:37+00:00,"The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber & a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
3881,2018-12-19 19:36:27+00:00,"Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
3882,2018-12-19 19:34:07+00:00,"Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp & elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
3883,2018-12-19 19:31:55+00:00,"Passive lateral safety is required by regulators & I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
3884,2018-12-19 19:27:44+00:00,"You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear."
3885,2018-12-19 19:24:16+00:00,"Pop up, park and walk!"
3886,2018-12-19 19:23:31+00:00,I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
3887,2018-12-19 19:19:29+00:00,"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles & let people decide what makes them happy"
3888,2018-12-19 19:15:09+00:00,"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated & belted for high speed safety."
3889,2018-12-19 19:09:16+00:00,Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
3890,2018-12-19 03:56:56+00:00,Precisely
3891,2018-12-19 03:55:01+00:00,Presentation starting at 8:15
3892,2018-12-19 03:35:45+00:00,"This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
3893,2018-12-19 03:32:14+00:00,"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination & then drives on normal roads back to start"
3894,2018-12-19 03:24:17+00:00,"Actually way more capacity, way faster & way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better."
3895,2018-12-19 03:21:54+00:00,All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians & cyclists
3896,2018-12-19 03:20:04+00:00,"Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
3897,2018-12-19 03:17:48+00:00,Yes
3898,2018-12-19 03:14:00+00:00,"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"
3899,2018-12-19 03:12:59+00:00,Tesla in @boringcompany tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again
3900,2018-12-18 22:14:35+00:00,Boring product launch will be streamed live at 8pm California time tonight
3901,2018-12-18 21:44:04+00:00,Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
3902,2018-12-18 21:18:22+00:00,Same applies to those who didn’t order PUP
3903,2018-12-18 20:52:58+00:00,Exactly. It’s a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
3904,2018-12-18 20:51:25+00:00,"Yeah, I wrote that back in 2006, almost 13 years ago!"
3905,2018-12-18 20:31:50+00:00,"Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*, eg computers & cell phones. It takes many design iterations & vast economies of scale to achieve mass market affordability."
3906,2018-12-18 15:17:51+00:00,Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX & Tesla!
3907,2018-12-18 06:46:52+00:00,Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiel’s Founder’s Fund: “we have no concerns whatsoever.”
3908,2018-12-17 05:37:55+00:00,"Same facts, same period of time, but extremely different reporting"
3909,2018-12-16 07:26:01+00:00,‘Tis
3910,2018-12-16 07:22:55+00:00,Medieval Futurism
3911,2018-12-16 05:32:58+00:00,Tesla app almost done. Important to get every note right!
3912,2018-12-16 04:08:09+00:00,Thanks!
3913,2018-12-15 21:44:27+00:00,The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats & just wipe it off.
3914,2018-12-15 21:26:04+00:00,Congratulations!
3915,2018-12-15 19:46:30+00:00,"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in 2 weeks, even if you haven’t placed an order yet"
3916,2018-12-15 19:29:43+00:00,You got it
3917,2018-12-15 19:23:38+00:00,Pretty good. I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build & interventions are rare. Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month.
3918,2018-12-15 07:58:23+00:00,
3919,2018-12-14 21:21:14+00:00,

3922,2018-12-14 04:00:40+00:00, ramen is sooo good 
3923,2018-12-14 03:44:31+00:00,Exactly 
3924,2018-12-13 17:42:40+00:00,This part is true. I was trying to explain that we don’t want our cars to have a “tinny” sound.
3925,2018-12-12 14:47:05+00:00,You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
3926,2018-12-11 16:53:42+00:00,Seems likely that we’ll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though 
3927,2018-12-11 16:28:49+00:00,"Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific, not executive role, which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”."
3928,2018-12-11 14:15:03+00:00,About 10 to 14 days
3929,2018-12-11 14:12:59+00:00,"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
3930,2018-12-11 14:08:56+00:00,"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks. To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at http://Tesla.com or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year."
3931,2018-12-11 13:54:51+00:00,No need to wait. It’s super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
3932,2018-12-11 13:50:22+00:00,I’m dying to make a pickup truck so bad … we might have a prototype to unveil next year
3933,2018-12-11 13:49:00+00:00,Yes
3934,2018-12-11 13:47:41+00:00,"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be."
3935,2018-12-11 13:12:16+00:00,Probably next month
3936,2018-12-11 13:07:20+00:00,You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.
3937,2018-12-11 12:23:52+00:00,"We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
3938,2018-12-11 06:48:11+00:00,Probably end of next year
3939,2018-12-11 06:37:47+00:00,So true 
3940,2018-12-11 06:13:15+00:00,This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
3941,2018-12-11 04:44:56+00:00,"60 Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to 14 mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party."
3942,2018-12-09 21:20:16+00:00,We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
3943,2018-12-09 19:18:36+00:00,"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability."
3944,2018-12-09 19:14:01+00:00,"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs & roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
3945,2018-12-09 19:12:04+00:00,"If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars & takes highway interchanges & off-ramps."
3946,2018-12-09 19:05:04+00:00,Machete!!
3947,2018-12-09 19:01:06+00:00,"It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car."
3948,2018-12-09 18:55:02+00:00,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later."
3949,2018-12-09 04:14:31+00:00,"Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe & later China."
3950,2018-12-09 04:09:06+00:00,"Buying http://Tesla.com took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didn’t like http://teslamotors.com even when we were only making ."
3951,2018-12-09 03:52:57+00:00,"Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
3952,2018-12-09 03:42:14+00:00,"Both, but demo Starship is being built now, whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring"
3953,2018-12-09 03:40:28+00:00,But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
3954,2018-12-09 03:37:58+00:00,Yes
3955,2018-12-09 03:35:11+00:00,Interesting
3956,2018-12-09 01:31:39+00:00,"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
3957,2018-12-09 01:09:35+00:00,The new design is metal
3958,2018-12-08 22:27:16+00:00,"As far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint."
3959,2018-12-07 00:18:21+00:00,Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars & ground to tunnel car elevators.
3960,2018-12-05 22:37:01+00:00,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
3961,2018-12-05 19:29:23+00:00,"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."
3962,2018-12-05 18:46:14+00:00,"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump & lines."
3963,2018-12-05 18:39:21+00:00,We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
3964,2018-12-05 18:36:55+00:00,"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
3965,2018-12-05 18:34:58+00:00,"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged & is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
3966,2018-12-05 18:08:04+00:00,Falcon/Dragon launch to @Space_Station in 9 minutes
3967,2018-12-04 19:27:34+00:00,Us too sigh
3968,2018-12-03 19:49:07+00:00,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out & launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
3969,2018-12-03 19:42:43+00:00,64 satellites on this flight!
3970,2018-12-03 02:22:29+00:00,"We’re adding police car, fire truck & ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months"
3971,2018-12-03 01:50:29+00:00,"Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop & turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
3972,2018-12-02 04:39:52+00:00,It is so hard to move in armor!
3973,2018-12-02 02:07:04+00:00,You’re all hired!
3974,2018-12-02 01:55:17+00:00,Yes … no … maybe …
3975,2018-12-02 01:50:19+00:00,None shall pass!
3976,2018-12-01 23:56:04+00:00,Ok
3977,2018-12-01 23:00:06+00:00,Good advice
3978,2018-12-01 22:47:38+00:00,Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
3979,2018-12-01 22:39:53+00:00,Glad you’re ok
3980,2018-12-01 20:48:07+00:00,"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
3981,2018-12-01 20:45:48+00:00,"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
3982,2018-12-01 20:42:16+00:00,"Incoming rocket & fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
3983,2018-12-01 19:28:30+00:00,You got it!
3984,2018-12-01 19:12:59+00:00,"Three things, one of which is CH4"
3985,2018-12-01 18:51:50+00:00,No
3986,2018-12-01 18:50:00+00:00,No
3987,2018-12-01 18:48:56+00:00,"Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Can’t wipe it off."
3988,2018-12-01 17:44:35+00:00,Haha
3989,2018-12-01 17:43:45+00:00,"Prof Dahn is correct (he’s great), but the relative benefit is small. I’d recommend 10% more SoC for convenience."
3990,2018-12-01 05:57:38+00:00,"Not worth going below 80% imo. Even 90% is still fine. Also, no issue going to 5% or lower SoC."
3991,2018-12-01 04:46:51+00:00,True 
3992,2018-12-01 04:14:08+00:00, 
3993,2018-11-30 20:50:57+00:00,Both
3994,2018-11-30 19:06:46+00:00,Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time
3995,2018-11-30 07:05:43+00:00,One day
3996,2018-11-30 06:50:38+00:00,"We’re doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but we’re just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead."
3997,2018-11-30 06:13:05+00:00,Update soon
3998,2018-11-29 23:18:39+00:00,Sorry 
3999,2018-11-29 22:11:13+00:00,Boring breakthrough @BoringCompany
4000,2018-11-29 19:06:05+00:00,Definitely
4001,2018-11-29 18:51:16+00:00,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car"
4002,2018-11-29 18:49:16+00:00,We tried. Nintendo won’t license it to us.
4003,2018-11-29 18:46:22+00:00,That would be cool
4004,2018-11-29 18:41:16+00:00,Haha kinda true 
4005,2018-11-29 18:35:34+00:00,Never heard of it
4006,2018-11-29 18:34:25+00:00,"Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor & more video games."
4007,2018-11-29 18:21:17+00:00,Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
4008,2018-11-29 17:42:40+00:00,Yes
4009,2018-11-29 02:33:32+00:00,"This is completely backwards. Based on what we’ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we’re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won’t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda."
4010,2018-11-29 02:25:39+00:00,"You can summon your Tesla from your phone. Only short distances today, but in a few years summon will work from across the continent."
4011,2018-11-28 23:43:50+00:00,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive."
4012,2018-11-28 08:21:59+00:00,Tiny wizard 
4013,2018-11-27 14:49:04+00:00,7 to 10 years
4014,2018-11-27 14:44:35+00:00,"Engineers, artists & creators of all kinds. There is so much to build."
4015,2018-11-27 06:25:42+00:00,Touché
4016,2018-11-27 04:49:40+00:00,"But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work"
4017,2018-11-26 21:57:27+00:00,"Varies per person, but about 80 sustained, peaking above 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80."
4018,2018-11-26 21:49:23+00:00,"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week"
4019,2018-11-26 21:48:22+00:00,"Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then @SpaceX, @Tesla, @BoringCompany &amp; @Neuralink are the places to be."
4020,2018-11-26 21:08:31+00:00,Congratulations! What an amazing track record of success with Mars!

4022,2018-11-26 08:40:12+00:00,1000 liters of pure water costs $1
4023,2018-11-26 07:24:33+00:00,"For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs 0.1 cents per liter or half a cent per gallon"
4024,2018-11-26 06:56:13+00:00,Ah yes fair point
4025,2018-11-26 04:37:33+00:00,"Used to live in Silicon Valley, now I live in Silicone Valley"
4026,2018-11-26 04:16:33+00:00,Not yet
4027,2018-11-26 03:44:33+00:00, trouble
4028,2018-11-26 03:31:03+00:00,Earth is
4029,2018-11-26 03:25:14+00:00,"Earth’s crust is only ~1% of Earth mass, so technically we should be called Lava"
4030,2018-11-26 01:46:39+00:00,"Earth should be called Water. Our surface is 71% water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as it’s all land. Even when warmed up & water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about 2/3 land."
4031,2018-11-26 00:05:11+00:00,"Yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting"
4032,2018-11-25 22:48:16+00:00,"Contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks & heatshield"
4033,2018-11-23 20:28:38+00:00,"If you don’t want a Tesla, here’s a list of all electric cars in North America https://cleantechnica.com/2018/01/07/electric-vehicles-for-sale-usa/ via @cleantechnica"
4034,2018-11-22 00:10:23+00:00,Signing off for a while
4035,2018-11-21 23:53:24+00:00,Happy Thanksgiving!!
4036,2018-11-21 23:29:28+00:00, Starships were meant to fly 
4037,2018-11-21 21:13:13+00:00,Starship Tooters
4038,2018-11-21 21:08:42+00:00,Good one
4039,2018-11-21 15:57:52+00:00,Good idea
4040,2018-11-21 15:43:22+00:00,Coming soon
4041,2018-11-21 15:42:12+00:00,Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
4042,2018-11-21 06:43:35+00:00,Should be next week
4043,2018-11-20 04:48:26+00:00,"No, it’s the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon 9"
4044,2018-11-20 04:45:32+00:00,Later versions will
4045,2018-11-20 04:44:55+00:00,"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage & Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
4046,2018-11-20 04:42:22+00:00,Renaming BFR to Starship
4047,2018-11-20 04:41:39+00:00,"No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR"
4048,2018-11-20 01:42:05+00:00,Yes
4049,2018-11-19 23:14:35+00:00,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
4050,2018-11-19 23:08:43+00:00,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
4051,2018-11-19 21:55:00+00:00,"No, it’s got enough load capacity & volume to carry the battery pack & our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered."
4052,2018-11-19 21:50:02+00:00,"In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts & processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
4053,2018-11-19 21:47:50+00:00,"What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
4054,2018-11-19 21:01:49+00:00,"Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler & produce sooner or do all & produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
4055,2018-11-19 20:51:09+00:00,Ok
4056,2018-11-19 15:29:31+00:00,Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
4057,2018-11-19 15:06:30+00:00,Absolutely agree
4058,2018-11-19 15:04:08+00:00,Investigating
4059,2018-11-19 15:02:49+00:00,Probably mid 2019
4060,2018-11-19 15:00:42+00:00,Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
4061,2018-11-19 14:58:48+00:00,"Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
4062,2018-11-19 14:57:30+00:00,Should be possible. Please ask service & lmk response.
4063,2018-11-19 14:56:12+00:00,"No, but perhaps in a few years"
4064,2018-11-19 14:43:42+00:00,"Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
4065,2018-11-19 14:34:36+00:00,"Haha, just like Super Troopers"
4066,2018-11-19 14:30:52+00:00,Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
4067,2018-11-19 14:26:25+00:00,Will allow having your car picked up & dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
4068,2018-11-19 14:22:18+00:00,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
4069,2018-11-17 18:59:21+00:00,"Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA & USAF are supportive."
4070,2018-11-17 18:52:29+00:00,Radical change
4071,2018-11-17 18:45:42+00:00,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
4072,2018-11-17 18:19:09+00:00,It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
4073,2018-11-17 18:17:10+00:00,"Set air flow to recirculating mode & manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
4074,2018-11-17 04:59:11+00:00,Congratulations @BoringCompany on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
4075,2018-11-17 03:47:40+00:00,
4076,2018-11-17 03:18:12+00:00,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!
4077,2018-11-17 03:07:41+00:00,Missed miku concert sigh
4078,2018-11-17 03:03:46+00:00,Listening to Better Now
4079,2018-11-16 16:44:15+00:00,"China, especially, is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation & transport"
4080,2018-11-16 16:31:18+00:00,"Sure hope this isn’t true. It is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict."
4081,2018-11-16 16:22:18+00:00,Haha 
4082,2018-11-15 21:02:06+00:00,Looking back at the sun from upper stage & Falcon 9 landed on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You
4083,2018-11-15 20:13:26+00:00,$5 per min to argue with knight. $12 for 3 min bulk discount.
4084,2018-11-15 19:45:11+00:00,While (!castle) {brick++};
4085,2018-11-15 19:31:23+00:00,Watchtower (feat. knight) will be at LA/Hawthorne tunnel entrance
4086,2018-11-15 19:08:27+00:00,Fortnite irl
4087,2018-11-15 19:07:07+00:00,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks & a picture.
4088,2018-11-15 18:58:44+00:00,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
4089,2018-11-15 18:54:32+00:00,Not much but it is ours
4090,2018-11-15 18:46:05+00:00,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks & we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent
4091,2018-11-15 17:55:14+00:00,"We have to truck to departure rail head & truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too & trains don’t leave often."
4092,2018-11-15 17:51:57+00:00,"Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"
4093,2018-11-15 17:46:30+00:00,Yes
4094,2018-11-15 17:45:20+00:00,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe & Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
4095,2018-11-15 17:40:58+00:00,We bought some trucking companies & secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
4096,2018-11-15 17:36:46+00:00,Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
4097,2018-11-15 17:35:20+00:00,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload & direct to owner location."
4098,2018-11-15 17:27:09+00:00,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30
4099,2018-11-14 17:18:22+00:00,We will fight Big Tequila!
4100,2018-11-14 17:08:10+00:00,That would be awesome
4101,2018-11-14 16:25:20+00:00,Easily accessible energy
4102,2018-11-14 15:49:33+00:00,Send me a note!
4103,2018-11-14 15:46:11+00:00,Would be fun to add to Tesla
4104,2018-11-14 03:09:28+00:00,Yes
4105,2018-11-14 03:08:37+00:00,Will try again next month
4106,2018-11-14 03:04:40+00:00,"Congratulations @SpaceX team! Thanks @NASA, much appreciated."
4107,2018-11-12 19:26:19+00:00,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination & delight you created for humanity will last forever."
4108,2018-11-12 07:23:55+00:00,Is he ok?
4109,2018-11-11 08:46:26+00:00,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
4110,2018-11-11 08:29:35+00:00,Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
4111,2018-11-10 22:00:47+00:00,"Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms & partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)"
4112,2018-11-10 21:39:16+00:00,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
4113,2018-11-10 21:26:56+00:00,"That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
4114,2018-11-10 21:19:43+00:00,"We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far …"
4115,2018-11-10 19:14:48+00:00,Because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do
4116,2018-11-10 05:14:53+00:00,"Good, but not hospital grade. S & X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid & alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3."
4117,2018-11-10 05:10:32+00:00,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S & X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
4118,2018-11-09 17:41:06+00:00,"Fair point, will reenable"
4119,2018-11-09 05:05:25+00:00,"Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety."
4120,2018-11-09 05:01:46+00:00,Please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
4121,2018-11-09 04:24:33+00:00,Cool
4122,2018-11-09 01:31:11+00:00,"With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster"
4123,2018-11-09 01:28:15+00:00,Yes
4124,2018-11-08 08:40:37+00:00,Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
4125,2018-11-07 21:27:00+00:00,"No, we’re building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
4126,2018-11-07 20:17:44+00:00,Won’t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield & high Mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
4127,2018-11-07 19:32:48+00:00,Aiming for orbital flight by June
4128,2018-11-07 19:31:07+00:00,Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon 9 second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship
4129,2018-11-07 16:41:23+00:00,But comments are 
4130,2018-11-07 00:44:31+00:00,LA/Hawthorne demonstration tunnel activates Dec 10. Runs parallel to 105 freeway from Crenshaw Blvd to 405.

4145,2018-11-03 07:37:40+00:00,So underappreciated
4146,2018-11-03 07:36:00+00:00,Ok
4147,2018-11-03 07:32:34+00:00,Ok
4148,2018-11-03 07:31:10+00:00,Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec 10. Will be very one-dimensional.
4149,2018-11-03 07:20:48+00:00,"Sounds like pure luxury! When I said ‘sponge’, I was actually speaking metaphorically. Truth is, I was just a simple nucleotide, drifting alone in small crevice with 3 trillion siblings."
4150,2018-11-03 07:09:31+00:00,What is love?
4151,2018-11-03 06:52:29+00:00,Bikini Bottom
4152,2018-11-03 06:50:10+00:00,Fair
4153,2018-11-03 06:48:38+00:00,"Yes, that is how"
4154,2018-11-03 06:45:32+00:00,We didn’t even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
4155,2018-11-03 06:42:39+00:00,Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
4156,2018-11-03 06:12:04+00:00,Wow that’s cool!
4157,2018-11-03 05:35:29+00:00,Kids these days have it easy
4158,2018-11-03 05:30:04+00:00,I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
4159,2018-11-03 05:19:36+00:00,Haha
4160,2018-11-03 05:18:01+00:00,First movie I ever saw in theaters
4161,2018-11-03 05:14:17+00:00,When the only existing life was a sponge
4162,2018-11-03 05:13:54+00:00,Although it was in the precambrian era
4163,2018-11-03 05:09:33+00:00,Star Wars only had an $11M budget. Must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low budgets.
4164,2018-11-03 02:17:39+00:00,They’re great! Honored to work with them.
4165,2018-11-03 00:56:00+00:00,Yes
4166,2018-11-02 21:15:15+00:00,Definitely
4167,2018-11-02 20:58:03+00:00,"Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation"
4168,2018-11-02 20:53:29+00:00,"Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa & South America end of next year, with broader expansion in 2020"
4169,2018-11-02 20:51:00+00:00,"Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China & Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases."
4170,2018-11-02 20:44:56+00:00,"To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
4171,2018-11-02 20:42:18+00:00,"Tesla will manufacture all battery modules & packs at China Giga, as we do today in California & Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."
4172,2018-11-02 19:43:35+00:00,"Amazing results by @Panasonic at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"
4173,2018-11-02 16:39:52+00:00,Prob 2 to 3 weeks
4174,2018-11-02 06:23:24+00:00,v true

4179,2018-11-01 21:19:44+00:00, Norway 
4180,2018-11-01 19:35:57+00:00,"#’s r wrong, but in Tesla makes s 4 overseas &amp; East Coast in 1st half of quarter"
4181,2018-11-01 10:55:25+00:00,"Long-term, the car will work purely on vision, with radar just a plus, but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway"
4182,2018-11-01 10:48:25+00:00,
4183,2018-11-01 07:15:04+00:00,We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety.
4184,2018-11-01 06:59:49+00:00,Hahaha 
4185,2018-11-01 06:52:43+00:00,Um yes
4186,2018-11-01 06:43:50+00:00,"Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon & say who’s the pet now …"
4187,2018-11-01 06:36:31+00:00,"Also, you’ll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big RC car if in line of sight"
4188,2018-11-01 06:25:48+00:00,Car will drive to your phone location & follow you like a pet if you hold down summon button on Tesla app
4189,2018-11-01 05:46:00+00:00,"Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade, so will work on all cars made in past 2 years (Autopilot hardware V2+)."
4190,2018-10-31 19:41:45+00:00,Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM
4191,2018-10-31 17:47:03+00:00,"For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm it’s valid & park."
4192,2018-10-31 17:38:02+00:00,Cool haha
4193,2018-10-29 22:06:31+00:00,"Legally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer & secretary. Guess I have to keep 1st one or it will confuse the authorities."
4194,2018-10-29 21:44:07+00:00,"Good point, might put that one back"
4195,2018-10-29 20:43:53+00:00,Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. I’m now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
4196,2018-10-27 03:54:33+00:00,Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
4197,2018-10-27 03:50:03+00:00,"Don’t worry, we’ll make it right"
4198,2018-10-27 03:44:57+00:00,The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can’t wait.
4199,2018-10-27 03:40:47+00:00,Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
4200,2018-10-27 03:36:15+00:00,"It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action …"
4201,2018-10-27 03:32:17+00:00,"Exactly, this is total bs. What part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!?"
4202,2018-10-27 03:30:31+00:00,We will enable track mode for all performance cars
4203,2018-10-27 03:29:22+00:00,"It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund & free Supercharging turned off, we will do that."
4204,2018-10-27 03:27:24+00:00,"Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund"
4205,2018-10-27 03:26:20+00:00,"Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer"
4206,2018-10-27 03:22:55+00:00,Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that.
4207,2018-10-27 03:00:03+00:00,Exactly. That’s Monday.
4208,2018-10-27 02:49:29+00:00,"Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."
4209,2018-10-27 02:41:17+00:00,"No, but I will"
4210,2018-10-27 02:40:10+00:00,Isn’t it obvious?
4211,2018-10-27 02:38:27+00:00,Worth it
4212,2018-10-27 02:37:35+00:00,True
4213,2018-10-27 01:54:17+00:00,Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
4214,2018-10-27 01:51:47+00:00,"Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal."
4215,2018-10-27 01:48:27+00:00,Haha
4216,2018-10-27 01:45:56+00:00,"On Insta, 10% of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get 1%."
4217,2018-10-27 01:37:05+00:00,Lacks scale
4218,2018-10-27 01:34:05+00:00,"Reddit is massive, but def has gems"
4219,2018-10-27 01:24:39+00:00,"Reddit’s twitter account is lame, because it’s not real Reddit"
4220,2018-10-27 01:17:37+00:00,Exactly
4221,2018-10-27 01:16:21+00:00,You’re right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
4222,2018-10-27 01:10:11+00:00,"On Twitter, likes are rare & criticism is brutal. So hardcore. It’s great."
4223,2018-10-26 23:05:55+00:00,Glad you’re ok @tylerthecreator
4224,2018-10-26 22:01:08+00:00,"S is better, but rear seat folds down in Model 3, so bikes can fit in trunk"

4226,2018-10-26 19:11:30+00:00,Good question
4227,2018-10-26 18:02:12+00:00,"Clearly, you’re not reading my twitter"
4228,2018-10-26 18:01:08+00:00,I wish
4229,2018-10-26 17:29:41+00:00,Taking action. Tesla body shops now operating in California aiming for same day body repair in most cases.
4230,2018-10-26 16:50:20+00:00,Yes Zorbix
4231,2018-10-26 16:44:59+00:00,"Sir, I would never …"

4251,2018-10-25 17:50:31+00:00, in 
4252,2018-10-25 17:44:07+00:00,Fresh puro from my meme dealer
4253,2018-10-25 16:47:58+00:00,Exactly. There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store.
4254,2018-10-25 16:43:20+00:00,"Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements & no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model 3 was product alone."
4255,2018-10-25 07:35:32+00:00,Massive thanks to Tesla owners & supporters. We wouldn’t be here without you.
4256,2018-10-25 06:48:11+00:00,Same
4257,2018-10-25 06:47:44+00:00,2025
4258,2018-10-25 06:46:13+00:00,How’d they know!?
4259,2018-10-25 05:11:54+00:00,Around mid 2019
4260,2018-10-23 19:51:26+00:00,"There have been hundreds of improvements to fit & finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
4261,2018-10-23 19:47:37+00:00,Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
4262,2018-10-23 19:18:25+00:00,Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn’t look like a radiator grill opening.
4263,2018-10-23 19:10:28+00:00,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
4264,2018-10-23 18:28:13+00:00,"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S & X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want."
4265,2018-10-23 10:38:42+00:00,"Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"
4266,2018-10-23 05:53:17+00:00,Working on it
4267,2018-10-23 05:17:56+00:00,That is correct
4268,2018-10-23 05:12:12+00:00,Twitter thought I got hacked & locked my account haha

4276,2018-10-22 21:45:13+00:00,"Hopefully, a few months for Drive on Navigation capability. We need to address differences in how lane lines are painted. Varies greatly by country."
4277,2018-10-22 18:29:42+00:00,Good point …
4278,2018-10-22 18:15:48+00:00,Interesting
4279,2018-10-22 18:08:57+00:00,"This is a ~ 6000 ft demo tunnel. First operational, high-speed tunnel still set for Chicago, pending regulatory approvals."

4288,2018-10-21 21:01:49+00:00,Twitter is Dark Souls of social media. Reddit is Bloodborne. Insta is Zelda.
4289,2018-10-21 20:46:52+00:00,Good idea!
4290,2018-10-21 20:46:30+00:00,"This game is my personal favorite, but I am biased towards space stuff"

4296,2018-10-20 04:31:17+00:00,BoredElonMusk is my secret troll account. It’s time people knew.
4297,2018-10-20 04:27:35+00:00,"No, bored me, I will not"
4298,2018-10-20 04:15:50+00:00,Maybe phone as controller
4299,2018-10-20 03:43:21+00:00,Exactly

4308,2018-10-19 18:43:14+00:00,I hope this is true!
4309,2018-10-19 03:39:34+00:00,"If you don’t like a Tesla for any reason or no reason, you can just give it back for a full refund"
4310,2018-10-18 23:41:42+00:00,Also available off menu for a week. Was causing too much confusion.
4311,2018-10-18 23:32:55+00:00,"Model 3 long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so"
4312,2018-10-18 23:30:13+00:00,"It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see."
4313,2018-10-18 23:19:44+00:00,"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow & ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires."
4314,2018-10-18 23:14:39+00:00,"It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February"
4315,2018-10-18 23:10:26+00:00,"Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model 3 & super simple new order page"
4316,2018-10-18 22:24:44+00:00,Week or two

4325,2018-10-17 17:51:39+00:00,"Yes, aiming for next few months"
4326,2018-10-17 17:51:12+00:00,"True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months & all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
4327,2018-10-17 00:32:30+00:00,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
4328,2018-10-17 00:30:19+00:00,Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America & realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.

4333,2018-10-16 07:50:56+00:00,~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
4334,2018-10-16 07:39:30+00:00,Somewhere between 500% & 2000%
4335,2018-10-16 07:36:52+00:00,"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU & better use of discrete GPU."
4336,2018-10-15 23:09:48+00:00,"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."

4393,2018-10-05 16:37:29+00:00,"When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
4394,2018-10-05 15:55:24+00:00,"Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds & small investors, thus increasing wealth divide."
4395,2018-10-05 07:50:23+00:00,V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.

4404,2018-10-05 00:54:16+00:00,"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors & retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
4405,2018-10-05 00:49:04+00:00,"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base & gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"

4410,2018-10-04 22:40:08+00:00,Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.

4650,2018-08-07 17:49:27+00:00,Yes
4651,2018-08-07 17:40:47+00:00,I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.
4652,2018-08-07 17:28:17+00:00,Good morning

4654,2018-08-07 16:48:13+00:00,Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.
4655,2018-08-06 00:37:48+00:00,Maybe Thursday
4656,2018-08-06 00:04:08+00:00,Great work by @OpenAI. Need the neural interface soon to enable human/AI symbiosis.

4660,2018-08-05 20:47:38+00:00,"Early access will have bugs (usually minor, but you never know for sure), so would not advise early access unless you’re prepared to have something go wrong"

4663,2018-08-05 20:30:08+00:00,Much more interesting
4664,2018-08-05 20:29:21+00:00,"Games & other refinements will go to all Tesla S, X & 3 from start of production. Autopilot enhancements apply to all Model 3’s plus S & X made in last few years (needs Autopilot Hardware V2.0 or higher)."
4665,2018-08-05 20:24:34+00:00,Glad you’re enjoying Model 3 & thanks for buying a Tesla! Major enhancements to Autopilot & fun games coming in a month with V9.0.

4667,2018-08-05 19:47:47+00:00,Def worth it. Model 3 Performance is next-level.

4702,2018-07-31 18:37:52+00:00,We should be really worried about this
4703,2018-07-31 18:37:16+00:00,No
4704,2018-07-31 18:36:43+00:00,"Yeah, Model 3 is designed to fit 6’4” adults comfortably in both front & rear seats at same time"
4705,2018-07-31 18:33:53+00:00,"We’re adding a “party & camper mode” soon to S/3/X, so your car can maintain air flow, temp, selective lights, music & power devices for 48 hours or more while parked. Big batteries rock …"
4706,2018-07-31 18:27:44+00:00,"Not having a big gas guzzler engine in front means there’s room for trunks in front & back, plus longer crumple zone for best safety of any midsize car"

4739,2018-07-23 23:43:06+00:00,We’ve gone from ~1000 S/X deliveries per week in US last year to ~6000 S/3/X. It’s like hitting a square wave.
4740,2018-07-23 22:56:08+00:00,"We’re trying to get rid of contracts completely. Should just be “tap here & you get your car”. Then, if you don’t like it for any reason, just return it like any other product."
4741,2018-07-23 18:26:37+00:00,Yeah. Never seen it so high ever.
4742,2018-07-23 18:24:35+00:00,"Wow, that’s really awesome. Thank you! @TeslaOwnersUK"
4743,2018-07-23 08:09:03+00:00,Haha
4744,2018-07-23 06:59:33+00:00,"Looks good, but so many details need to be right. Journey back from hypersonic becomes extremely difficult as velocity increases. Altitude is easy, velocity is hard."
4745,2018-07-23 06:45:35+00:00,Only costs that actually apply to Q3 & beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.

4747,2018-07-23 04:45:06+00:00,Congratulations to all teams in the student @Hyperloop competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!
4748,2018-07-22 01:05:22+00:00,"Exactly. Overheat protection is always on, but you can also tap “maintain” & your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked."
4749,2018-07-21 22:29:31+00:00,"Yes, Tesla Model S, X & 3 all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked"

4759,2018-07-21 03:14:04+00:00,I made that up tbh. They did not have phones during the French Revolution. They used Friendster.
4760,2018-07-21 03:04:49+00:00,Don’t make me bite my thumb at you
4761,2018-07-21 03:02:27+00:00,For sure
4762,2018-07-21 02:59:46+00:00,"Btw, 1792 is calling & wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?"
4763,2018-07-21 02:38:14+00:00,"Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime & save lives of many birds."
4764,2018-07-21 02:11:18+00:00,No kidding
4765,2018-07-21 01:26:05+00:00,"Yes, that will probably be its first use"
4766,2018-07-21 01:23:45+00:00,"Phew . Yeah, we had a drain block 3 months ago &amp; people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"
4767,2018-07-21 00:05:24+00:00,I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
4768,2018-07-20 23:50:29+00:00,"Figuratively, literally or both?"
4769,2018-07-20 20:27:19+00:00,That has always been our goal
4770,2018-07-20 19:50:30+00:00,"This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. “Other US” refers to Boeing & Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts & subsidies vastly exceeds ours."
4771,2018-07-20 00:50:44+00:00,"Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over 2000 S/X and 5000 Model 3 *new* net orders."
4772,2018-07-20 00:47:47+00:00,Definitely. We gave up some grip & width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires & wider on rear for best performance. You might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims & tires.
4773,2018-07-18 20:44:13+00:00,"Wow, someone has really thought about this!"
4774,2018-07-18 19:36:21+00:00,I wish
4775,2018-07-18 06:41:16+00:00,"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone."
4776,2018-07-18 06:38:33+00:00,"As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths & suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness & according to specifications from the dive team leader."
4777,2018-07-17 23:51:11+00:00,Good point
4778,2018-07-15 14:41:30+00:00,I have never donated to a SuperPAC
4779,2018-07-15 03:15:29+00:00,"Yes, about 0.5% of what I donated to @SierraClub, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue"
4780,2018-07-15 03:06:26+00:00,Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
4781,2018-07-15 02:29:05+00:00,Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.
4782,2018-07-15 00:25:59+00:00,"That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
4783,2018-07-14 22:57:54+00:00,So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
4784,2018-07-14 22:46:55+00:00,"Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent & politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me & I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone."
4785,2018-07-14 19:35:53+00:00,Actually true
4786,2018-07-14 02:56:21+00:00,Hold up a mirror & see if it fogs

4792,2018-07-14 01:39:21+00:00,Feels like a show & tell weekend. I wonder what the cat dragged in …

4812,2018-07-12 09:09:52+00:00,Would love to. It’s been too long.
4813,2018-07-12 09:09:20+00:00,Prob early next year
4814,2018-07-12 09:04:03+00:00,Just finished an amazing 3 day visit to China. The world has never seen human energy & vigor at such scale. Incredibly impressed with Tesla China team & potential for the future.
4815,2018-07-12 08:48:57+00:00,Sure 
4816,2018-07-12 08:44:18+00:00,"Look, at least it’s not the Magellanic Clouds. They’re basically next door."
4817,2018-07-12 08:41:58+00:00,"Just between us, I have a teleportation stargate to the Andromeda galaxy. It’s amazing."
4818,2018-07-12 08:37:13+00:00,So true
4819,2018-07-12 07:12:19+00:00,The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. They stopped shortly after boys were rescued & water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. That was great work.
4820,2018-07-12 03:46:35+00:00,Sounds good
4821,2018-07-12 03:43:14+00:00,Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
4822,2018-07-11 22:39:40+00:00,It will happen for sure. Damn.
4823,2018-07-11 22:19:14+00:00,Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?
4824,2018-07-11 22:16:20+00:00,Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn’t. Wonder why.
4825,2018-07-11 21:53:49+00:00,"Damn, now I want donuts "
4826,2018-07-11 21:46:31+00:00,Yeah
4827,2018-07-11 21:41:13+00:00,Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
4828,2018-07-11 21:22:18+00:00,"You’re right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they’ve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues & hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good."
4829,2018-07-11 21:16:31+00:00,Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
4830,2018-07-11 21:12:35+00:00,"For now, reply to my tweet with ppm & ppb test results & will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com, but I’m in China so that won’t be working until tomorrow."
4831,2018-07-11 20:52:27+00:00,Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
4832,2018-07-11 20:48:24+00:00,Great move
4833,2018-07-11 20:43:14+00:00,Why sir …

4835,2018-07-11 14:35:58+00:00,Good point
4836,2018-07-11 14:33:31+00:00,"Definitely. Can’t wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon."
4837,2018-07-11 14:31:42+00:00,"Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline"
4838,2018-07-11 14:30:45+00:00,Well … it looked smaller on paper

4840,2018-07-11 08:49:41+00:00,"Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump & generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue."
4841,2018-07-11 08:37:55+00:00,It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
4842,2018-07-11 08:27:16+00:00,Makes a lot of sense
4843,2018-07-11 08:20:44+00:00,This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option & worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.
4844,2018-07-11 07:16:08+00:00,I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
4845,2018-07-11 06:47:01+00:00,Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
4846,2018-07-10 23:03:15+00:00,Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
4847,2018-07-10 22:26:24+00:00,Please lmk results of your water tests
4848,2018-07-10 22:20:21+00:00,"When you’re there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?"
4849,2018-07-10 17:24:40+00:00,Should be very soon. We’ve already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.
4850,2018-07-10 17:19:04+00:00,Exactly

4856,2018-07-10 14:10:14+00:00,"Moreover, based on extensive cave video review & discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey & demonstrate at any time."
4857,2018-07-10 14:03:36+00:00,"The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:"
4858,2018-07-10 12:33:34+00:00,Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
4859,2018-07-10 07:48:42+00:00,Ok
4860,2018-07-09 22:05:01+00:00,Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts & named Wild Boar after kids’ soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.
4861,2018-07-09 19:31:49+00:00,That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
4862,2018-07-09 01:14:38+00:00,A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
4863,2018-07-09 00:45:25+00:00,Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
4864,2018-07-09 00:39:46+00:00,"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."

4866,2018-07-08 23:16:02+00:00,"Thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
4867,2018-07-08 23:12:37+00:00,"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
4868,2018-07-08 22:58:22+00:00,Tube diameter is 31cm
4869,2018-07-08 21:49:47+00:00,"Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
4870,2018-07-08 21:40:00+00:00,Thanks @palicharterhigh for letting us use your pool
4871,2018-07-08 21:25:54+00:00,It is an honor to work with them
4872,2018-07-08 20:59:46+00:00,"With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space"
4873,2018-07-08 20:55:12+00:00,
4874,2018-07-08 18:54:23+00:00,I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz …
4875,2018-07-08 18:51:52+00:00,It is both alarming & explanatory that you run a psych ward
4876,2018-07-08 18:48:22+00:00,"Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections."
4877,2018-07-08 18:40:45+00:00,"Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio & phone/music player."
4878,2018-07-08 18:27:43+00:00,"Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm."

4880,2018-07-08 18:17:44+00:00,Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
4881,2018-07-08 18:14:39+00:00,"Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it’s on a plane to Thailand"

4892,2018-07-08 06:50:04+00:00,"Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
4893,2018-07-08 05:48:44+00:00,Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed.
4894,2018-07-08 00:57:36+00:00,Yes
4895,2018-07-07 21:19:38+00:00,Yes
4896,2018-07-07 20:10:53+00:00,Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights & adjust bouyancy.
4897,2018-07-07 19:57:58+00:00,Yes
4898,2018-07-07 19:55:45+00:00,"4 handles/hitch points on front & 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front & 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
4899,2018-07-07 19:19:47+00:00,I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
4900,2018-07-07 18:39:12+00:00,"Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand"
4901,2018-07-07 18:35:31+00:00,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience & tenacity of kids & diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
4902,2018-07-07 18:02:43+00:00,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
4903,2018-07-07 17:52:57+00:00,Ground winds would
4904,2018-07-07 17:26:01+00:00,Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
4905,2018-07-07 09:33:12+00:00,Can’t be too buoyant
4906,2018-07-07 08:06:58+00:00,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
4907,2018-07-06 22:46:43+00:00,Good idea
4908,2018-07-06 22:36:50+00:00,"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack."
4909,2018-07-06 22:28:10+00:00,You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 
4910,2018-07-06 22:23:27+00:00,"Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
4911,2018-07-06 22:18:50+00:00,Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall.
4912,2018-07-06 22:04:11+00:00,It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
4913,2018-07-06 21:42:09+00:00,"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
4914,2018-07-06 21:10:37+00:00,I would def recommend this
4915,2018-07-06 21:09:16+00:00,Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
4916,2018-07-06 20:39:56+00:00,Interesting
4917,2018-07-06 19:05:21+00:00,"Great, thanks"
4918,2018-07-06 18:53:56+00:00,Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
4919,2018-07-06 17:27:39+00:00,"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water won’t come in"
4920,2018-07-06 16:48:00+00:00,"Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
4921,2018-07-06 07:42:41+00:00,SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
4922,2018-07-06 07:36:44+00:00,"Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit."
4923,2018-07-06 06:13:44+00:00,"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
4924,2018-07-06 06:09:25+00:00,Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
4925,2018-07-06 05:41:30+00:00,"Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
4926,2018-07-06 05:29:45+00:00,Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
4927,2018-07-05 22:48:22+00:00,Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for & parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
4928,2018-07-05 22:32:18+00:00,"I know you & believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"
4929,2018-07-05 22:25:36+00:00,I didn’t ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don’t work for me. They just don’t like hypocrites.
4930,2018-07-05 21:40:53+00:00,They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don’t use Facebook.
4931,2018-07-05 21:39:15+00:00,Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was “dancing her face off” with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?
4932,2018-07-05 21:35:22+00:00,Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos’s cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective
4933,2018-07-05 21:21:48+00:00,
4934,2018-07-05 21:20:47+00:00,.@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption “Love both these dudes”. Doesn’t sound very objective
4935,2018-07-05 20:11:18+00:00,"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
4936,2018-07-05 20:07:53+00:00,Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette &amp; supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
4937,2018-07-05 19:22:22+00:00,Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
4938,2018-07-05 19:04:55+00:00,True
4939,2018-07-05 18:42:01+00:00,"So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism."
4940,2018-07-05 18:13:40+00:00,".@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
4941,2018-07-05 18:02:49+00:00,What a coincidence …
4942,2018-07-05 18:01:10+00:00,Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
4943,2018-07-05 17:26:44+00:00,"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
4944,2018-07-05 17:09:40+00:00,"Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
4945,2018-07-05 11:33:02+00:00,"Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion."
4946,2018-07-05 10:06:12+00:00,"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself."
4947,2018-07-05 10:02:50+00:00,"Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
4948,2018-07-05 09:41:49+00:00,"@lopezlinette has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible."

5112,2018-06-20 08:31:50+00:00,Exactly
5113,2018-06-20 08:29:13+00:00,"He’s obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak & a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation."

5116,2018-06-20 08:05:47+00:00,"Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced & above 50% too negatively affects economic output."

5144,2018-06-19 03:47:35+00:00,It’s actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable & a great view of the mountains.
5145,2018-06-19 03:36:42+00:00,Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga & spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
5146,2018-06-19 03:25:38+00:00,They also poured the concrete & built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it’s way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!

5175,2018-06-17 17:55:54+00:00,Then you’ll be fine
5176,2018-06-17 17:50:55+00:00,Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter & simpler than most.
5177,2018-06-17 17:49:38+00:00,"...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate."

5179,2018-06-17 17:44:19+00:00,More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
5180,2018-06-17 17:40:58+00:00,How big is your short position? Just curious.
5181,2018-06-17 17:36:54+00:00,Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda & hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
5182,2018-06-17 17:31:00+00:00,"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
5183,2018-06-17 17:16:19+00:00,"UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls & far left shills to trash Tesla & me in press & social media. Such creeps."
5184,2018-06-17 17:00:07+00:00,"I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too."
5185,2018-06-17 16:55:05+00:00,"I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."

5258,2018-06-10 19:46:37+00:00,"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
5259,2018-06-10 19:37:31+00:00,It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
5260,2018-06-10 18:47:39+00:00,Love this design. Simpler the better.
5261,2018-06-10 18:29:38+00:00,Add an R for Roadster 
5262,2018-06-10 18:27:08+00:00,"Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
5263,2018-06-10 18:19:23+00:00,A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
5264,2018-06-10 18:16:58+00:00,"Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
5265,2018-06-10 18:12:43+00:00,Will do
5266,2018-06-10 18:09:41+00:00,"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) & O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
5267,2018-06-10 12:27:56+00:00,"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another."
5268,2018-06-10 12:16:50+00:00,"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
5269,2018-06-10 12:10:09+00:00,"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
5270,2018-06-10 12:01:51+00:00,"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now & fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
5271,2018-06-10 06:33:43+00:00,"This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I’d know everything’s fine & no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh "

NYT, KR & Hearst were all major investors in Zip2."

Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?€}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
5274,2018-06-10 02:51:50+00:00,"In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU & CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly & direct flipping of CPU registers. That company’s name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony."
5275,2018-06-10 02:35:12+00:00,"That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents"
5276,2018-06-09 23:45:53+00:00,"At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps & calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages & business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading & real estate apps."
5277,2018-06-09 23:33:04+00:00,"More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack & a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college.

5278,2018-06-09 23:23:00+00:00,"We don’t think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k."
5279,2018-06-09 22:59:18+00:00,"Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further."
5280,2018-06-09 22:49:43+00:00,"19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 & a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way…"
5281,2018-06-09 22:29:50+00:00,"SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly …"

5288,2018-06-09 20:18:13+00:00,I think so :)

5291,2018-06-08 17:29:38+00:00,We’re building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast & excellent outcome
5292,2018-06-08 17:24:20+00:00,Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version.
5293,2018-06-08 17:04:46+00:00,Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
5294,2018-06-08 16:11:01+00:00,"Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with 50% larger inner diameter"
5295,2018-06-08 04:06:25+00:00,And we’re definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
5296,2018-06-08 04:05:05+00:00,"Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form …"
5297,2018-06-08 04:02:12+00:00,Running track in @SpaceX BF Spaceship will look something like this
5298,2018-06-07 23:24:57+00:00,"No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S & X w HW2 Autopilot & all Model 3 cars."
5299,2018-06-07 22:47:11+00:00,Working on improving

5304,2018-06-06 01:07:06+00:00,"We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to 6 months though, not 2 years."
5305,2018-06-05 19:25:49+00:00,Congratulations @murraymatt. Good move by @WSJ. Please use Matt’s Twitter pic. Essence of a good editor

5312,2018-06-03 05:11:18+00:00,Definitely
5313,2018-06-03 05:11:05+00:00,"Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob won’t offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value."
5314,2018-06-03 05:02:38+00:00,Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It’s a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week’s.
5315,2018-06-02 18:39:45+00:00,Next year

5324,2018-06-02 16:01:19+00:00,"Usually, they don’t even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so."
5325,2018-06-02 15:57:36+00:00,Actually true!
5326,2018-06-02 15:54:40+00:00,"Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability."
5327,2018-06-02 15:47:47+00:00,"But don’t worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels & everything’s just fine https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal"
5328,2018-06-02 15:42:51+00:00,"Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each car’s exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy."
5329,2018-06-02 14:56:13+00:00,The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
5330,2018-06-01 22:45:32+00:00,Glad you’re ok!

5333,2018-06-01 08:25:09+00:00,That sounds like a fun adventure!
5334,2018-06-01 08:23:54+00:00,You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel & it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.
5335,2018-06-01 02:47:53+00:00,"Model 3 should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little on S/X."
5336,2018-06-01 02:45:30+00:00,"Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen & particulate of almost any kind"
5337,2018-06-01 02:41:22+00:00,"Model S & X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter & a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model 3."
5338,2018-06-01 02:13:19+00:00,"Cool, Tesla S/X have hospital operating room air quality when BWD mode is activated, so shd protect against even a weaponized virus"

5348,2018-05-31 05:18:53+00:00,Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
5349,2018-05-31 04:18:00+00:00,Hell of a week

5352,2018-05-30 22:35:53+00:00,You’re most welcome. More to come in this regard.
5353,2018-05-30 22:34:02+00:00,"Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading & point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair & accurate in their criticism."
5354,2018-05-30 19:09:23+00:00,"Ride comfort & aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there’s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%."
5355,2018-05-30 19:05:41+00:00,Prob 8.3
5356,2018-05-30 19:04:36+00:00,Yes

5359,2018-05-30 16:40:06+00:00,"Braking & UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise & suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you’re really bothered by them, don’t replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort."
5360,2018-05-30 16:30:21+00:00,"Yeah, absolutely"
5361,2018-05-30 16:28:56+00:00,Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.
5362,2018-05-30 16:12:13+00:00,Like you guys too 
5363,2018-05-30 16:05:58+00:00,"Actually, Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube & each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered."

5371,2018-05-29 17:32:04+00:00,This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite!
5372,2018-05-29 17:04:47+00:00,"“Nano” is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Would’ve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman."
5373,2018-05-29 16:56:03+00:00,"Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I’m against science is like saying Beyoncé doesn’t know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue."
5374,2018-05-29 16:43:58+00:00,"Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didn’t set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science & I said that was false. Are you saying I don’t have the right to deny false accusations? That’s messed up."
5375,2018-05-29 09:14:08+00:00,"You’ve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I’m against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don’t represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too"
5376,2018-05-29 06:09:58+00:00,Great book. Read it when it came out.

5385,2018-05-29 00:37:52+00:00,"Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions & not lose money."

5389,2018-05-29 00:06:35+00:00,Noted. We can prob adjust spring force & catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!
5390,2018-05-28 23:34:58+00:00,You’re welcome. Appreciate the letter.

5399,2018-05-28 02:40:37+00:00,Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
5400,2018-05-27 02:14:20+00:00,You’re right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off …
5401,2018-05-27 02:11:19+00:00,Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
5402,2018-05-27 01:59:46+00:00,You’re missing the point & living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesn’t trust you. This was true *before* the last election & only got worse. Don’t believe me? Run your own poll …
5403,2018-05-27 01:51:14+00:00,"You’re welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming I’m against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media."
5404,2018-05-27 01:48:17+00:00,You really think I haven’t spent time in a newsroom? I’ve spent time in too many. Bleak.
5405,2018-05-27 01:42:37+00:00,"Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"

5409,2018-05-27 01:21:40+00:00,"Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model 3 started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks @ConsumerReports for excellent critical feedback!"

5428,2018-05-26 22:04:56+00:00,"Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this “non-journalist” who is also pro gasoline cars? Is this just published as counterpoint? I assume NYT does believe in climate change?"

5431,2018-05-26 20:30:27+00:00,"Yeah, that’s exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought."
5432,2018-05-26 19:50:31+00:00,The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
5433,2018-05-26 19:38:49+00:00,Well said. NYT journo is outraged that “dumb” public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh...
5434,2018-05-26 19:19:30+00:00,A Tesla has a usable reserve of 5 to 15 miles range even after the battery reads “empty”. This will not hurt the pack.

5446,2018-05-26 17:42:12+00:00,"Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too."
5447,2018-05-26 11:06:45+00:00,Can’t believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!!

5449,2018-05-26 02:53:53+00:00,Tesla will start extending the Supercharger network to South America around end of next year
5450,2018-05-26 02:52:18+00:00,Prob end of next year

5455,2018-05-25 23:04:27+00:00,All four. Zone 3 throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
5456,2018-05-25 22:55:12+00:00,Model 3 was designed for min engineering & tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe & Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
5457,2018-05-25 22:37:01+00:00,This is the new production line for battery module Zone 4. Will play a key role in getting from 3000/week to 6000/week for Model 3.
5458,2018-05-25 21:44:14+00:00,I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
5459,2018-05-25 19:35:38+00:00,"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year & is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out."
5460,2018-05-25 18:45:23+00:00,Worth a shot
5461,2018-05-25 18:43:26+00:00,Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It’s called “satire” …
5462,2018-05-25 18:34:10+00:00,"This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
5463,2018-05-25 18:27:06+00:00,"Problem solved, was able to buy http://Pravduh.com! Game on …"
5464,2018-05-25 18:23:43+00:00,"I know, I know. Russia seriously didn’t correct me on this!"
5465,2018-05-25 18:23:42+00:00,"Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd …"
5466,2018-05-25 18:23:42+00:00,"Turns out http://Pravda.com is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
5467,2018-05-25 18:23:41+00:00,"For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
5468,2018-05-25 17:52:22+00:00,"Tried to buy http://Pravda.com, but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it."
5469,2018-05-25 03:03:08+00:00,"Definitely did not. I’ve been through many press cycles & know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
5470,2018-05-25 02:52:30+00:00,I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest & yet believe that same public is too stupid & immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
5471,2018-05-25 02:36:18+00:00,The Tesla facility is open plan & we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well & they are some of the worst & best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.
5472,2018-05-25 00:30:07+00:00,No
5473,2018-05-25 00:25:51+00:00,Nano applies to everything & therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry. http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Nanotechnology
5474,2018-05-24 23:41:05+00:00,"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world & products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
5475,2018-05-24 23:37:52+00:00,"Wow, you’re ignorant. Don’t remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law & land you in jail. I didn’t review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
5476,2018-05-24 11:52:31+00:00,Done
5477,2018-05-24 10:28:20+00:00,Have a confirmed real name identity section & an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
5478,2018-05-24 10:15:55+00:00,Be careful what you wish for
5479,2018-05-24 10:03:09+00:00,"Amazingly, the “media is awesome” vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll "
5480,2018-05-24 09:56:28+00:00,My point exactly
5481,2018-05-24 09:15:49+00:00,"Ahem, you have “nano” in your bio. That is 100% synonymous with bs."
5482,2018-05-24 08:39:55+00:00,Reddit is great
5483,2018-05-24 08:32:08+00:00,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
5484,2018-05-24 07:59:09+00:00,Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
5485,2018-05-24 05:36:11+00:00,"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
5486,2018-05-24 05:20:20+00:00,I did to any who asked
5487,2018-05-24 05:08:07+00:00,"That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product & it didn’t work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
5488,2018-05-24 04:59:43+00:00,"Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like & what needs to be improved"
5489,2018-05-24 04:52:41+00:00,"But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right."
5490,2018-05-24 04:50:55+00:00,"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
5491,2018-05-24 04:48:29+00:00,Gasoline or diesel?
5492,2018-05-24 04:46:17+00:00,What car do you drive?
5493,2018-05-24 04:08:37+00:00,March 15
5494,2018-05-24 04:02:55+00:00,The media
5495,2018-05-24 01:46:49+00:00,"Hi Kara! I’m open to it. Right now, I’m cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
5496,2018-05-24 01:42:45+00:00,"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called “You’re Right!” I do actually own http://youreright.com, but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
5497,2018-05-24 01:29:44+00:00,Definitely
5498,2018-05-24 00:47:52+00:00,"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these and this is the best one "
5499,2018-05-24 00:44:25+00:00,Yo
5500,2018-05-24 00:43:29+00:00,That’s the basic idea
5501,2018-05-24 00:42:55+00:00,"For some reason, this is the best I’ve felt in a while. Hope you’re feeling good too "
5502,2018-05-24 00:34:37+00:00,"I just tried to donate, but you don’t accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
5503,2018-05-23 22:58:07+00:00,"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
5504,2018-05-23 22:58:07+00:00,Thank you! I thought it was so obvious …
5505,2018-05-23 22:24:15+00:00,Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
5506,2018-05-23 21:14:36+00:00,"Yeah, I think you do great work"
5507,2018-05-23 20:38:33+00:00,"If you’re in media & don’t want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it …"
5508,2018-05-23 20:24:28+00:00, 
5509,2018-05-23 20:23:05+00:00,"I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived & gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
5510,2018-05-23 20:10:27+00:00,Of course
5511,2018-05-23 19:55:10+00:00,"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla & millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real & be a good company."
5512,2018-05-23 19:48:45+00:00,"No, they’re just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
5513,2018-05-23 19:45:27+00:00,Will do
5514,2018-05-23 19:41:15+00:00,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
5515,2018-05-23 19:28:39+00:00,That’s why editors are included too
5516,2018-05-23 19:23:45+00:00,We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
5517,2018-05-23 19:21:00+00:00,"Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves."
5518,2018-05-23 19:18:36+00:00,Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
5519,2018-05-23 19:17:13+00:00,Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
5520,2018-05-23 19:16:07+00:00,"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek & unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
5521,2018-05-23 19:14:32+00:00,Exactly
5522,2018-05-23 19:12:53+00:00,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …"
5523,2018-05-23 19:05:55+00:00,An exception that proves the rule
5524,2018-05-23 19:03:47+00:00,"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
5525,2018-05-23 18:59:59+00:00,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers."
5526,2018-05-23 18:54:48+00:00,The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
5527,2018-05-23 18:48:46+00:00,Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful & the public will believe you again.
5528,2018-05-23 18:32:01+00:00,"Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
5529,2018-05-23 18:25:21+00:00,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them"
5530,2018-05-23 10:23:33+00:00,"This will sound super obvious, but Genesis & Oblivion"
5531,2018-05-23 10:21:42+00:00,I am not cool
5532,2018-05-23 10:15:34+00:00,The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
5533,2018-05-23 10:04:07+00:00,"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so I’m glad there’s some good too . Her music is incredible."
5534,2018-05-23 05:32:05+00:00,Thanks. Not super fun right now 
5535,2018-05-23 05:10:28+00:00,Busted 
5536,2018-05-23 05:06:44+00:00,"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together & messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
5537,2018-05-23 04:46:06+00:00,"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics & backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
5538,2018-05-22 23:01:33+00:00,Great idea!
5539,2018-05-22 22:37:08+00:00,Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
5540,2018-05-22 22:35:03+00:00,Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
5541,2018-05-22 20:14:57+00:00,Interesting he stops at ‘09. That’s when you drove GM & Chrysler into bankruptcy & lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
5542,2018-05-22 19:34:33+00:00,Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 
5543,2018-05-22 19:32:39+00:00,"But ya know what, let’s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago & left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them & wages were lower. Maybe. Let’s hold a vote & find out."
5544,2018-05-22 18:37:56+00:00,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM & Chrysler to bankruptcy & lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over & now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry & everyone knows it."
5545,2018-05-22 18:07:07+00:00,"We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X & 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
5546,2018-05-22 18:04:55+00:00,Good point
5547,2018-05-22 18:02:10+00:00,"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness & enforcement of 2 class “lords & commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers & workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
5548,2018-05-22 17:51:32+00:00,"More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, & they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler & GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article …"
5549,2018-05-22 17:39:29+00:00,No problem
5550,2018-05-22 17:33:09+00:00,"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
5551,2018-05-22 15:48:17+00:00,"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
5552,2018-05-22 15:34:03+00:00,I didn’t meet with him
5553,2018-05-22 05:28:04+00:00,I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise.
5554,2018-05-22 04:43:32+00:00,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
5555,2018-05-22 04:26:33+00:00,"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
5556,2018-05-22 04:20:51+00:00,"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
5557,2018-05-22 04:17:10+00:00,"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production."
5558,2018-05-22 04:13:05+00:00,ABS calibration algorithm
5559,2018-05-22 04:10:25+00:00,"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
5560,2018-05-22 04:07:16+00:00,"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
5561,2018-05-22 03:18:51+00:00,"Stop, you’re making me blush "
5562,2018-05-22 03:07:08+00:00,"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
5563,2018-05-22 03:04:25+00:00,Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
5564,2018-05-22 01:38:52+00:00,"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
5565,2018-05-22 01:38:09+00:00,"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this."
5566,2018-05-22 01:33:27+00:00,"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
5567,2018-05-22 01:31:10+00:00,"Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
5568,2018-05-21 21:15:03+00:00,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers & beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com."
5569,2018-05-21 07:10:01+00:00,Gwynne’s awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
5570,2018-05-21 07:06:54+00:00, 
5571,2018-05-21 07:05:19+00:00,"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
5572,2018-05-21 06:44:47+00:00,Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.
5573,2018-05-21 06:26:37+00:00,"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by Reveal."
5574,2018-05-21 03:49:28+00:00,We’re working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak & pinpoint origin by acoustic signature & triangulation
5575,2018-05-21 03:46:55+00:00,SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to @NASA Plum Brook vacuum chamber
5576,2018-05-21 03:30:56+00:00,For sure before snowfall this year
5577,2018-05-21 03:16:40+00:00,It can tow far more than rated capacity
5578,2018-05-21 03:12:58+00:00,Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
5579,2018-05-21 03:08:30+00:00,"With production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live."
5580,2018-05-21 01:19:47+00:00,That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
5581,2018-05-21 01:17:37+00:00,Exactly ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
5582,2018-05-21 01:10:39+00:00,"Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union."
5583,2018-05-21 01:06:58+00:00,"About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried & hourly, union & non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally & on social media & lied about it."
5584,2018-05-20 08:52:16+00:00,Yes
5585,2018-05-20 08:51:54+00:00,Exactly
5586,2018-05-20 08:51:53+00:00,They can form a union whenever they want & there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.
5587,2018-05-20 06:42:35+00:00,Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
5588,2018-05-20 06:40:25+00:00,"They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
5589,2018-05-20 06:37:40+00:00,"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell"
5590,2018-05-20 06:36:58+00:00,Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
5591,2018-05-20 06:35:54+00:00,"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
5592,2018-05-20 06:34:39+00:00,Good idea ...
5593,2018-05-20 06:34:02+00:00,That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
5594,2018-05-20 06:31:40+00:00,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
5595,2018-05-20 06:27:16+00:00,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph.
5596,2018-05-20 06:22:04+00:00,Black & white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
5597,2018-05-20 06:19:57+00:00,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
5598,2018-05-20 06:18:58+00:00,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
5599,2018-05-20 06:13:38+00:00,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec 0-60mph 155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range"
5600,2018-05-20 06:09:53+00:00,"It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
5601,2018-05-20 06:06:54+00:00,Exactly
5602,2018-05-20 06:05:02+00:00,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself & zero paperwork.
5603,2018-05-20 05:58:01+00:00,I’m about to test the configurator & then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
5604,2018-05-20 05:55:26+00:00,"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
5605,2018-05-20 05:50:53+00:00,That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
5606,2018-05-20 02:15:03+00:00,"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” Performance wheels, black & white interior."
5607,2018-05-20 01:41:41+00:00,"AC induction front & switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output & get double the burn-in."
5608,2018-05-19 20:52:19+00:00,Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive & performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.

5618,2018-05-17 06:45:53+00:00,Listening to REALiTi
5619,2018-05-17 02:56:40+00:00,"Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
5620,2018-05-16 10:47:32+00:00,Yes
5621,2018-05-16 10:02:37+00:00,Will be presenting & taking questions about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at 7pm on Thursday
5622,2018-05-16 09:59:21+00:00,Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground & ocean to spaceport in 10 to 15 mins
5623,2018-05-14 21:06:27+00:00,"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
5624,2018-05-14 21:03:22+00:00,"It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released."
5625,2018-05-14 20:57:33+00:00,What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
5626,2018-05-14 20:54:12+00:00,"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tesla-with-autopilot-slams-into-truck-stopped-at-red-light/2018/05/12/18d2e740-563e-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.7466cb626644"
5627,2018-05-14 20:15:17+00:00,Yes
5628,2018-05-14 19:40:19+00:00,"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
5629,2018-05-14 19:00:17+00:00,"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."
5630,2018-05-14 00:29:10+00:00,Happy Mother’s Day Mom! Love you so much.
5631,2018-05-14 00:27:15+00:00,"Fair criticism, but we’re fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
5632,2018-05-14 00:16:33+00:00,Lovely story
5633,2018-05-13 01:42:15+00:00,"If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I can’t figure them out."
5634,2018-05-13 00:37:15+00:00,"SpaceX will prob build 30 to 40 rocket cores for ~300 missions over 5 years. Then BFR takes over & Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars & eventually outer planets."
5635,2018-05-13 00:29:39+00:00,Good piece by Ars
5636,2018-05-12 23:42:04+00:00,Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
5637,2018-05-12 23:37:43+00:00,"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines — quaint, but not something you’d actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines & trains in general."
5638,2018-05-12 23:33:10+00:00,"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
5639,2018-05-12 02:16:09+00:00,Yo
5640,2018-05-11 22:24:30+00:00,Will make that a setting
5641,2018-05-11 22:20:42+00:00,"Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week"
5642,2018-05-11 22:16:52+00:00,No use arguing with chimp. You’re blocked.
5643,2018-05-11 22:03:57+00:00,"That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla & SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass …"
5644,2018-05-11 20:12:07+00:00,I have publicly asked people (like you) not to invest. Go fund Ford or whatever …

5646,2018-05-11 19:55:22+00:00,"AWD & white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, that’s when we *start* making them. Can’t instantly fill all orders. Will take 6+ months to do so."
5647,2018-05-11 19:52:22+00:00,"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange …"
5648,2018-05-11 19:21:31+00:00,"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
5649,2018-05-11 16:40:57+00:00,Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD & performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
5650,2018-05-11 02:13:24+00:00,A cool thing about the design is that’s easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
5651,2018-05-11 02:07:14+00:00,Already started DC to NY route. Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true @Hyperloop w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels &amp; faster than jetliner.

5653,2018-05-11 00:42:07+00:00,"Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country & will be there in person for the launch."
5654,2018-05-11 00:39:58+00:00,"This will work on entire S & X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
5655,2018-05-10 11:11:17+00:00,"All X & S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth, signal strength is high & you enable feature"
5656,2018-05-10 11:07:44+00:00,"Yeah, we will add that as a feature"

5697,2018-05-05 00:15:48+00:00,Thanks for letting me know. Will expedite. Sorry for the delay.
5698,2018-05-05 00:09:58+00:00,"Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If you’re short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit …"
5699,2018-05-04 21:08:58+00:00,New Roadster will have that
5700,2018-05-04 13:13:14+00:00,"Yes, definitely not"
5701,2018-05-04 13:10:49+00:00,It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
5702,2018-05-04 13:02:16+00:00,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
5703,2018-05-04 12:43:59+00:00,Yup
5704,2018-05-04 12:34:04+00:00,"True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
5705,2018-05-04 12:21:20+00:00,"We went through the same drama on S & X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
5706,2018-05-04 12:04:51+00:00,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising & no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
5707,2018-05-04 11:55:43+00:00,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
5708,2018-05-04 11:35:25+00:00,"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
5709,2018-05-04 11:18:26+00:00,Exactly
5710,2018-05-04 11:17:34+00:00,"First, it’s important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market & has been for a while"
5711,2018-05-04 11:12:07+00:00,Please ignore this thread unless you’re interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
5712,2018-05-04 10:44:51+00:00,They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
5713,2018-05-04 09:53:18+00:00,"Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S & X are producing major positive cash flow & Model 3 is about to do same."
5714,2018-05-04 09:38:19+00:00,"To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
5715,2018-05-04 09:20:24+00:00,"The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."
5716,2018-05-03 07:36:02+00:00,You’re most welcome
5717,2018-05-02 22:56:23+00:00,Your numbers are incorrect. Tesla Fremont is 3rd in world after a place &amp; mall. Giga will be largest when complete.

5745,2018-04-16 04:06:48+00:00,"We already do targeted retro burn to a specific point in Pacific w no islands or ships, so upper stage doesn’t become a dead satellite. Need to retarget closer to shore & position catcher ship like Mr Steven."

5754,2018-04-13 19:54:52+00:00,"Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated."
5755,2018-04-13 08:11:31+00:00,"The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now it’s just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable & cash flow+ in Q3 & Q4, so obv no need to raise money."
5756,2018-04-13 07:58:05+00:00,"Sorry, demand has been higher than expected. Making them as fast as possible, but waitlist is 3 to 6 months."
5757,2018-04-13 07:51:59+00:00,Looking into it. This is bizarre.

5773,2018-04-08 05:13:20+00:00,We need to achieve 5k/week with Model 3 before adding complexity that would inhibit production ramp
5774,2018-04-08 04:00:18+00:00,"This is kinda nutty for such a short distance, so could easily end up being shredded metal, but exciting either way"
5775,2018-04-08 03:44:36+00:00,Upgraded SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pod speed test soon. Will try to reach half speed of sound (and brake) within ~1.2km.
5776,2018-04-08 02:41:40+00:00,Model 3 is the whole point. We only made the more expensive cars in order to make the mass-market car. We lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until now.

Car biz is hell …"

5792,2018-04-02 19:10:25+00:00,"Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I’m sure there’s a really great answer …"
5793,2018-04-02 19:03:56+00:00,"Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries & deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?"
5794,2018-04-02 18:52:38+00:00,"Seriously! Obviously, I’m not going to do an April Fool’s joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh)."
5795,2018-04-02 18:37:37+00:00,"Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately & always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe."

5832,2018-03-24 21:08:57+00:00,I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness & safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.
5833,2018-03-23 19:11:24+00:00,You’ll live
5834,2018-03-23 18:59:52+00:00,We’ve never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
5835,2018-03-23 17:31:23+00:00,"Instagram’s probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I don’t use FB & never have, so don’t think I’m some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don’t advertise or pay for endorsements, so … don’t care."
5836,2018-03-23 17:06:20+00:00,Ok

5838,2018-03-23 16:13:35+00:00,"Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance."
5839,2018-03-23 16:11:02+00:00,Definitely. Looks lame anyway.
5840,2018-03-23 16:10:13+00:00,First time I’ve seen either. One on the left looks official. Will be gone soon.

5963,2018-02-12 16:41:20+00:00,"That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high."
5964,2018-02-12 16:30:41+00:00,"Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
5965,2018-02-12 15:44:01+00:00,"The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."

6028,2018-01-28 13:25:16+00:00,Hmm ... portal gun. Now that would be interesting.
6029,2018-01-28 06:40:23+00:00,You’d need millions of zombies for a so-called “apocalypse” anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?
6030,2018-01-28 06:03:40+00:00,The rumor that I’m secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false

6045,2018-01-15 04:07:05+00:00,Done
6046,2018-01-15 03:53:50+00:00,"Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features."
6047,2018-01-13 05:25:58+00:00,There aren’t even good normal parties in Silicon Valley!
6048,2018-01-12 19:09:24+00:00,"Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original."
6049,2018-01-09 18:37:23+00:00,That sounds cool. Will do.

6065,2017-12-26 18:53:13+00:00,Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature I’d like to add.
6066,2017-12-26 18:51:05+00:00,"Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining Model 3 ramp."

6096,2017-12-21 16:34:45+00:00,"However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive."
6097,2017-12-21 16:19:33+00:00,"Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out."
6098,2017-12-21 16:09:42+00:00,"For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses."
6099,2017-12-21 16:07:35+00:00,"Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren’t (having “PhD” in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. That’s what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit “expert”."

6105,2017-12-20 21:22:33+00:00,Falcon Heavy launching from same @NASA pad as the Saturn V Apollo 11 moon rocket. It was 50% higher thrust with five F-1 engines at 7.5M lb-F. I love that rocket so much.
6106,2017-12-20 21:13:17+00:00,Max thrust at lift-off is 5.1 million pounds or 2300 metric tons. First mission will run at 92%.

6285,2017-09-27 00:03:12+00:00,Headed to Adelaide soon to describe new BFR planetary colonizer design in detail @IAC2017. This should be worth seeing. Design feels right.

6297,2017-09-16 02:16:49+00:00,Def not ok. Just sent a reminder to Tesla stores that we just want people to look forward to their next visit. That's what really matters.
6298,2017-09-16 00:28:05+00:00,In discussions with national govt. Just need a temporary reprieve on local content requirements until we can build a factory in India.
6299,2017-09-16 00:19:49+00:00,What if we just made a mini version of the Tesla Semi?

6360,2017-08-25 19:21:56+00:00,Let me check on that for you. Found the answer right here: 
6361,2017-08-25 19:20:19+00:00,It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.
6362,2017-08-25 19:17:49+00:00,WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.
6363,2017-08-25 19:14:48+00:00,Neuralink is not raising money
6364,2017-08-25 08:14:02+00:00,"Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears"
6365,2017-08-25 05:48:57+00:00,"Max velocity: Mach 6.9 Max altitude: 247 km Highest so far, but velocity matters much more"
6366,2017-08-25 05:32:42+00:00,Probably 2m or so
6367,2017-08-25 05:29:10+00:00,Exactly. Yeah.
6368,2017-08-25 05:28:00+00:00,Intentionally? Yes

6389,2017-08-19 21:19:47+00:00,Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
6390,2017-08-19 21:18:34+00:00,At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
6391,2017-08-19 21:17:23+00:00,Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery.
6392,2017-08-19 21:10:54+00:00,Will prob do something like that
6393,2017-08-19 20:23:13+00:00,Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
6394,2017-08-19 19:58:30+00:00,"Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest."
6395,2017-08-19 05:42:37+00:00,"Yeah, it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched"
6396,2017-08-19 01:11:17+00:00,Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases.

6411,2017-08-12 00:47:44+00:00,It is far too complex for that. Requires a team of the world's best AI researchers with massive computing resources.
6412,2017-08-12 00:41:45+00:00,"Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too."

6437,2017-08-05 23:50:39+00:00,It gets really dark
6438,2017-08-05 23:49:07+00:00,"True, there are frequent complaint expansion packs"
6439,2017-08-05 23:46:55+00:00,Except for complaining. That has remained constant throughout history at 100/100.
6440,2017-08-05 19:44:03+00:00,Officially verified as the first production electric car to exceed 1000km on a single charge! Congratulations Tesla Owners Italia!!
6441,2017-08-04 10:20:02+00:00,I guess a proof of concept is needed
6442,2017-08-03 18:27:26+00:00,Looking forward to launching @NASA astronauts to the International Space Station next year!
6443,2017-08-02 22:56:05+00:00,Sorry about that. You certainly should have been. Will get you guys in a car right away.
6444,2017-08-02 18:46:14+00:00,"No, must brake safely to a halt"
6445,2017-08-02 18:17:40+00:00,SpaceX student Hyperloop top speed competition coming up soon!
6446,2017-08-02 00:39:13+00:00,We poured our heart into the car. Hope you love it.
6447,2017-08-01 02:53:41+00:00,Sure hope so
6448,2017-07-31 18:02:58+00:00,Batteries!
6449,2017-07-31 15:48:14+00:00,"Thoughtful Model 3 review by @tsrandall, one of the most insightful journalists"
6450,2017-07-31 07:34:29+00:00,"There are several dozen ship names in the Culture series, but I liked those best"
6451,2017-07-31 06:41:26+00:00,Umm ...
6452,2017-07-30 19:11:05+00:00,"Yeah, it's better than a Model 3. We can put a lot more in a car at a higher price."
6453,2017-07-30 17:58:28+00:00,"I'm sure there are better answers than what I do, which is just take the pain and make sure you really care about what you're doing"
6454,2017-07-30 17:40:29+00:00,"If you buy a ticket to hell, it isn't fair to blame hell ..."
6455,2017-07-30 17:39:28+00:00,"Maybe not medically tho. Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for."
6456,2017-07-30 17:32:26+00:00,Yeah
6457,2017-07-30 17:23:11+00:00,"The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress. Don't think people want to hear about the last two."
6458,2017-07-30 17:15:17+00:00,Model 3 uses two intersecting planes of air for vertical control & lateral fins hidden within the dashboard for horizontal control

6461,2017-07-30 06:17:10+00:00,Probably middle of next year. Focus now is on getting out of Model 3 production hell. More versions = deeper in hell.
6462,2017-07-29 23:34:41+00:00,Yes
6463,2017-07-29 16:38:50+00:00,Sure
6464,2017-07-29 01:48:32+00:00,"Watched them personally to make sure & I agree with the outcome. Wouldn't have judged differently. Amazing videos all, but @MKBHD was best."
6465,2017-07-29 01:30:38+00:00,Couldn't believe how incredibly inspiring and creative they were!!
6466,2017-07-29 01:28:27+00:00,First!

6478,2017-07-25 07:38:45+00:00,Movie on the subject coming soon...
6479,2017-07-25 07:29:50+00:00,"Tim's piece on AI is excellent, but we actually face a double exponential rate of improvement. AI hardware & software are both exponential."
6480,2017-07-25 07:07:03+00:00,I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.

6482,2017-07-25 06:42:52+00:00,$US price in $AUD plus import duties and sales tax
6483,2017-07-25 06:39:52+00:00,We can't have too many direct shareholders or we're required to become a public co. Will check if possible through a feeder fund though.
6484,2017-07-25 06:37:00+00:00,Often comes as a surprise when people learn that 80% of my time is on engineering/design and just 20% on other stuff
6485,2017-07-22 17:31:17+00:00,A 9m diameter vehicle fits in our existing factories ...
6486,2017-07-22 00:25:13+00:00,"Yes, I postponed publishing in order to present the updated interplanetary rocket & spaceship design in Adelaide. Will be on the final day."
6487,2017-07-21 23:30:16+00:00,Discussing physics of tunnels with Mayor Vargas (who has a physics background). Hawthorne support for The Boring Company much appreciated.
6488,2017-07-21 21:09:43+00:00,Kinda have to :)
6489,2017-07-21 21:08:51+00:00,LA-SF-Reno/Sparks would be great. Tesla logistics costs for Sparks-Fremont (batteries & motors) and Fremont-LA (finished cars) are gigantic.
6490,2017-07-21 11:51:22+00:00,"Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state & city discussions."
6491,2017-07-21 02:52:08+00:00,Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
6492,2017-07-20 20:58:11+00:00,"An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go"
6493,2017-07-20 20:44:39+00:00,City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
6494,2017-07-20 20:40:48+00:00,"If you want this to happen fast, please let your local & federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you."
6495,2017-07-20 16:45:38+00:00,"Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly"
6496,2017-07-20 15:36:13+00:00,For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
6497,2017-07-20 15:31:18+00:00,Support would be much appreciated!
6498,2017-07-20 15:11:23+00:00,"City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city"
6499,2017-07-20 15:09:10+00:00,Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins.

6502,2017-07-17 19:56:13+00:00,"True. Need to explain full story of Tesla. So much nonsense out there, amplified by propaganda from some in fossil fuels & confused shorts."
6503,2017-07-17 19:43:59+00:00,Not attacking Electrek. Just making sure people don't have the wrong impression.
6504,2017-07-17 19:20:58+00:00,Not true. Email from customer.
6505,2017-07-17 19:12:43+00:00,"I should clarify: Tesla stock is obviously high based on past & present, but low if you believe in Tesla's future. Place bets accordingly …"

6507,2017-07-15 20:59:07+00:00,y
6508,2017-07-15 00:28:53+00:00,"It is true, so fine by me"
6509,2017-07-14 23:55:48+00:00,"Small thing (very small), but I made it this way for those who care and understand. Source and appearance are the same."
6510,2017-07-14 17:57:08+00:00,It's what you don't say
6511,2017-07-14 17:39:04+00:00,I do have one question. What does GoDaddy mean?
6512,2017-07-14 15:46:38+00:00,Good point
6513,2017-07-14 15:37:54+00:00,Fixed. Now it's good.
6514,2017-07-14 15:33:13+00:00,Yes
6515,2017-07-14 08:37:07+00:00,Stay tuned
6516,2017-07-14 08:33:21+00:00,I told you it was verbose. Better tomorrow :)
6517,2017-07-14 08:21:00+00:00,"Excited to announce the launch of http://x.com! It's a little verbose right now, but that will be fixed tomorrow."
6518,2017-07-14 06:29:16+00:00,Just checked and yes
6519,2017-07-14 06:05:27+00:00,"True. Also, Ariane primary bay can deliver slightly heavier satellites than Falcon 9. Falcon Heavy is needed ..."
6520,2017-07-14 05:51:37+00:00,Commercially procured launches means launches that were openly competed. SpaceX is not allowed to compete for many US and non-US launches.

6525,2017-07-13 22:46:47+00:00,That doesn't sound right
6526,2017-07-13 22:46:00+00:00,"Worth noting that Boeing/Lockheed (""Other US"" on chart) get a billion dollar annual subsidy even if they launch nothing. SpaceX does not."

6552,2017-07-05 22:25:06+00:00,SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good.
6553,2017-07-04 06:01:57+00:00,We're going to spend the 4th doing a full review of rocket & pad systems. Launch no earlier than 5th/6th. Only one chance to get it right …
6554,2017-07-03 22:44:00+00:00,Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.

6596,2017-06-25 20:56:21+00:00,New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.

6600,2017-06-25 19:55:34+00:00,"Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry."
6601,2017-06-25 04:58:37+00:00,"We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about 2 years ago"

6603,2017-06-25 04:15:00+00:00,Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
6604,2017-06-25 03:57:39+00:00,"True, but that's a minor factor for rockets"
6605,2017-06-25 03:56:51+00:00,"No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds."
6606,2017-06-25 03:53:29+00:00,"They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power & energy, but rocket has plenty of that."
6607,2017-06-25 03:48:44+00:00,"Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups"
6608,2017-06-25 03:44:03+00:00,Flying with larger & significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast & cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding.
6609,2017-06-24 00:18:56+00:00,Sticking to 100
6610,2017-06-23 19:34:35+00:00,"It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace"
6611,2017-06-23 19:32:18+00:00,"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good"
6612,2017-06-23 18:07:57+00:00,Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.

6661,2017-06-09 22:59:57+00:00,Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
6662,2017-06-09 22:53:18+00:00,Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly & are reluctant to adopt new tech.
6663,2017-06-09 22:47:21+00:00,"I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama … Prob worth doing?"
6664,2017-06-09 22:37:16+00:00,Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only 7% of parts ended up being common.
6665,2017-06-09 22:31:29+00:00,"Slow at first, then very fast. Def not hover."

6670,2017-06-09 19:52:37+00:00,Exactly

6679,2017-06-09 10:14:19+00:00,"Nothing to do w govt incentives or making money. Thought 90% prob of losing it all (almost did many times), but it was the only chance."

6753,2017-06-04 04:49:56+00:00,It's starting to feel kinda normal to reuse rockets. Good. That's how it is for cars & airplanes and how it should be for rockets.
6754,2017-06-03 18:51:19+00:00,First reflight of a Dragon spacecraft set for later today
6755,2017-06-02 09:20:00+00:00,Good point :)
6756,2017-06-01 22:48:03+00:00,India commits to sell only electric cars by 2030. It is already the largest market for solar power.
6757,2017-06-01 20:42:26+00:00,"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today"
6758,2017-06-01 20:02:13+00:00,Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.
6759,2017-06-01 16:28:22+00:00,Coming soon
6760,2017-06-01 07:41:42+00:00,Yeah :)
6761,2017-05-31 17:38:45+00:00,Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case
6762,2017-05-31 17:34:02+00:00,"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain"
6763,2017-05-31 06:10:00+00:00,And then some

6776,2017-05-25 06:43:28+00:00,"Falcon Heavy is this times three. One way or another, launch is guaranteed to be exciting ..."

6782,2017-05-23 22:34:36+00:00,True :)

6784,2017-05-23 02:59:20+00:00,All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
6785,2017-05-22 23:29:17+00:00,I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
6786,2017-05-22 23:26:03+00:00,Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
6787,2017-05-22 23:23:56+00:00,"Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
6788,2017-05-22 23:15:45+00:00,We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
6789,2017-05-22 23:14:36+00:00,"Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian & cyclist safety"
6790,2017-05-22 04:15:07+00:00,Exactly
6791,2017-05-22 02:34:38+00:00,Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
6792,2017-05-22 02:31:05+00:00,There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
6793,2017-05-22 02:29:42+00:00,HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
6794,2017-05-22 02:28:23+00:00,Hopefully June for those too
6795,2017-05-22 02:26:30+00:00,S for sure. It is a bigger car.
6796,2017-05-22 02:00:11+00:00,"I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3."
6797,2017-05-22 01:57:27+00:00,"Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that."
6798,2017-05-22 01:55:18+00:00,"Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth."
6799,2017-05-22 01:53:35+00:00,"Almost there, plus much improved web browser"
6800,2017-05-22 01:52:59+00:00,That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
6801,2017-05-22 01:50:47+00:00,Almost there. Probably in a few months.
6802,2017-05-22 01:49:09+00:00,"You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off :)"
6803,2017-05-22 01:47:37+00:00,Something cool for sure
6804,2017-05-22 01:46:53+00:00,Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.
6805,2017-05-22 01:42:45+00:00,"Model 3, Model X & Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision & control software."

6811,2017-05-19 23:09:25+00:00,"Still agree with Tim's points. What ""you"" are is an evolving, mind-body pattern, but there's still a core youness that holds true over time."

6913,2017-03-31 18:52:51+00:00,A lot
6914,2017-03-31 18:52:36+00:00,Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of 1st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend & Monty Python.
6915,2017-03-31 18:48:58+00:00,"Good point, odds go from 0% to >0% :)"
6916,2017-03-31 18:46:53+00:00,Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
6917,2017-03-31 18:44:25+00:00,"Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low, but maybe worth a shot."
6918,2017-03-31 18:41:25+00:00,Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob 6 weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.
6919,2017-03-31 00:36:12+00:00,Thanks Phil!
6920,2017-03-30 23:39:41+00:00,Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours.
6921,2017-03-29 23:51:19+00:00,"If you just downloaded V8.1, tap the the T on center screen three times"
6922,2017-03-29 20:07:43+00:00,"On center screen. Also, center screen *will* show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to relevance."
6923,2017-03-28 17:14:01+00:00,Very few. We have yet to do a China (or Europe) launch of Model 3.
6924,2017-03-28 17:04:59+00:00,Glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla
6925,2017-03-28 16:58:36+00:00,No
6926,2017-03-28 16:57:18+00:00,You won't care
6927,2017-03-28 10:21:31+00:00,What gave me away?
6928,2017-03-28 10:20:38+00:00,No
6929,2017-03-28 10:18:37+00:00,Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon & into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ...
6930,2017-03-28 04:31:21+00:00,"Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to."
6931,2017-03-24 22:34:44+00:00,We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
6932,2017-03-24 22:28:54+00:00,Yes
6933,2017-03-24 20:24:34+00:00,Yes
6934,2017-03-24 19:24:55+00:00,I believe so
6935,2017-03-24 18:13:34+00:00,Yup
6936,2017-03-24 17:50:03+00:00,Oh so little faith
6937,2017-03-24 17:25:32+00:00,The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
6938,2017-03-24 15:20:07+00:00,Yeah
6939,2017-03-24 15:18:47+00:00,Start taking orders in April
6940,2017-03-24 15:16:08+00:00,"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
6941,2017-03-24 15:12:36+00:00,"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles …"
6942,2017-03-24 15:09:41+00:00,The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
6943,2017-03-24 15:06:25+00:00,"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
6944,2017-03-24 15:05:32+00:00,No problem :)
6945,2017-03-24 15:05:14+00:00,"Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."
6946,2017-03-24 15:03:29+00:00,Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
6947,2017-03-24 14:55:34+00:00,"First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months."
6948,2017-03-24 14:54:24+00:00,Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
6949,2017-03-24 14:52:30+00:00,First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3
6950,2017-03-24 14:50:35+00:00,It still has one display
6951,2017-03-24 14:48:30+00:00,Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
6952,2017-03-24 14:47:05+00:00,"The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
6953,2017-03-24 14:45:18+00:00,How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
6954,2017-03-24 14:43:45+00:00,"Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
6955,2017-03-24 14:41:56+00:00,I think so
6956,2017-03-24 14:41:17+00:00,"No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
6957,2017-03-24 14:39:16+00:00,Tues/Wed
6958,2017-03-24 14:37:53+00:00,Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
6959,2017-03-24 14:36:46+00:00,Tues/Wed next week
6960,2017-03-24 14:35:30+00:00,"Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
6961,2017-03-24 14:34:42+00:00,"Yes, but not until next year"
6962,2017-03-24 14:34:08+00:00,Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
6963,2017-03-24 14:32:59+00:00,"Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
6964,2017-03-24 14:30:22+00:00,How about now?
6965,2017-03-24 14:30:00+00:00,Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
6966,2017-03-24 14:28:40+00:00,All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
6967,2017-03-24 14:27:13+00:00,Definitely
6968,2017-03-24 14:26:51+00:00,"Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)"
6969,2017-03-24 14:23:26+00:00,Yes
6970,2017-03-24 14:21:33+00:00,"Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range & power & fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
6971,2017-03-24 14:17:41+00:00,"Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."
6972,2017-03-24 14:15:11+00:00,Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
6973,2017-03-24 10:07:34+00:00,"I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
6974,2017-03-24 07:50:21+00:00,Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
6975,2017-03-24 07:44:56+00:00,The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
6976,2017-03-24 07:36:32+00:00,"Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle."
6977,2017-03-24 07:30:16+00:00,I hope that didn't work
6978,2017-03-24 07:29:31+00:00,~spawn npc.alien
6979,2017-03-24 07:18:23+00:00,Where are the #%*> aliens?
6980,2017-03-23 17:52:21+00:00,Looks like Tues/Wed for 8.1 release
6981,2017-03-22 21:54:14+00:00,Except that isn't actually my house ...
6982,2017-03-22 01:31:40+00:00,"Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it."
6983,2017-03-22 01:30:44+00:00,I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
6984,2017-03-16 04:39:03+00:00,"3 is a great car, but definitely Model S"
6985,2017-03-14 08:21:59+00:00,Good point
6986,2017-03-14 08:19:30+00:00,I wish. It's so annoying.
6987,2017-03-14 08:17:30+00:00,"Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ..."
6988,2017-03-13 01:26:47+00:00,Ok
6989,2017-03-12 21:43:07+00:00,"It's been a bear to get done, but prob 10 days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results"
6990,2017-03-12 21:41:41+00:00,"Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."
6991,2017-03-12 21:39:51+00:00,"Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency."
6992,2017-03-12 21:37:51+00:00,"Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches"
6993,2017-03-12 21:32:33+00:00,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially @mcannonbrookes"
6994,2017-03-12 19:40:37+00:00,I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
6995,2017-03-12 04:25:25+00:00,"Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
6996,2017-03-12 03:59:22+00:00,High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current
6997,2017-03-12 03:51:56+00:00,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power & electronics both DC."
6998,2017-03-12 03:43:47+00:00,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.
6999,2017-03-11 03:53:37+00:00,"Just spoke with @JayWeatherill, Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
7000,2017-03-10 07:27:06+00:00,"Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
7001,2017-03-10 07:05:11+00:00,$250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
7002,2017-03-10 02:50:57+00:00,Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
7003,2017-03-06 01:57:43+00:00,Will send you one
7004,2017-03-06 01:41:09+00:00,Self-hatred
7005,2017-03-06 01:34:53+00:00,Thanks JJ!
7006,2017-03-06 01:14:54+00:00,
7007,2017-03-02 01:31:54+00:00,Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it!
7008,2017-02-28 05:10:55+00:00,SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.
7009,2017-02-28 05:08:14+00:00,"This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it 7 or 8 times ever."
7010,2017-02-27 21:34:39+00:00,Fly me to the moon ... Ok
7011,2017-02-27 01:10:11+00:00,SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST
7012,2017-02-25 05:32:56+00:00,of course
7013,2017-02-25 04:49:52+00:00,maybe one of those too
7014,2017-02-25 04:46:30+00:00,Roller coasters are awesome
7015,2017-02-24 18:59:50+00:00,Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
7016,2017-02-24 18:01:17+00:00,Good chance it will
7017,2017-02-24 18:00:36+00:00,Exactly :)
7018,2017-02-24 17:51:49+00:00,I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
7019,2017-02-24 17:22:11+00:00,Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
7020,2017-02-23 12:22:31+00:00,Excellent Tesla Model X review
7021,2017-02-19 20:20:45+00:00,Just posted a video https://www.instagram.com/p/BQtNTk4Brqp/
7022,2017-02-19 15:08:17+00:00,
7023,2017-02-19 15:06:59+00:00,Baby came back https://www.instagram.com/p/BQspL7Qhv1v/
7024,2017-02-19 14:58:24+00:00,no
7025,2017-02-18 16:47:58+00:00,System was green for launch. I called it off.
7026,2017-02-18 16:37:50+00:00,"They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018."
7027,2017-02-18 16:14:15+00:00,"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
7028,2017-02-18 16:05:22+00:00,"Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
7029,2017-02-18 15:47:51+00:00,"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
7030,2017-02-18 15:21:05+00:00,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
7031,2017-02-18 15:11:41+00:00,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."
7032,2017-02-18 08:35:11+00:00,Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast… https://www.instagram.com/p/BQpXxl5BIYX/

7034,2017-02-18 08:07:03+00:00,"Provided Dragon 2 demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in 2018"
7035,2017-02-18 03:07:51+00:00,Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
7036,2017-02-17 17:45:17+00:00,"Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow."
7037,2017-02-17 15:55:44+00:00,"Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed"
7038,2017-02-17 06:42:32+00:00,It's much easier to do the CGI that way
7039,2017-02-16 23:46:04+00:00,Daylight rocket launch & landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the 1st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad.
7040,2017-02-16 04:47:56+00:00,I used that one :)
7041,2017-02-16 04:39:11+00:00,"Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much."
7042,2017-02-16 04:36:32+00:00,They are doing India proud
7043,2017-02-16 04:35:10+00:00,You may come to regret that request :)
7044,2017-02-16 04:33:50+00:00,"Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?"
7045,2017-02-16 04:31:18+00:00,"Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!"
7046,2017-02-16 04:29:15+00:00,"Apparently, there is this thing called ""Dad jokes"" and I make them"
7047,2017-02-16 04:21:12+00:00,"You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man..."
7048,2017-02-15 21:06:09+00:00,they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.
7049,2017-02-15 21:05:03+00:00,"In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited."
7050,2017-02-15 20:52:49+00:00,Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
7051,2017-02-15 02:33:11+00:00,Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
7052,2017-02-11 02:18:03+00:00,Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful
7053,2017-02-10 20:17:43+00:00,Falcon 9 rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex 39-A. This is the same launch… https://www.instagram.com/p/BQWBz9zgOTP/
7054,2017-02-10 02:51:02+00:00,Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
7055,2017-02-10 01:17:19+00:00,"Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday."
7056,2017-02-09 01:58:37+00:00,of course it will
7057,2017-02-08 21:49:54+00:00,Should all be uploaded by next month
7058,2017-02-08 21:31:39+00:00,Motor Trend could only achieve 2.4 sec when they tested the Porsche 918

7063,2017-02-07 17:13:33+00:00,"yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars."
7064,2017-02-07 16:23:27+00:00,"No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100."
7065,2017-02-07 16:11:34+00:00,"Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further"
7066,2017-02-07 16:08:19+00:00,"No plans to take X, S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above."

7072,2017-02-05 18:50:10+00:00,Almost ready
7073,2017-02-05 18:48:18+00:00,App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
7074,2017-02-05 18:41:42+00:00,"Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority"
7075,2017-02-05 18:41:06+00:00,I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
7076,2017-02-05 18:30:43+00:00,Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
7077,2017-02-05 18:21:41+00:00,A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
7078,2017-02-05 18:12:14+00:00,"Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text"
7079,2017-02-05 18:07:59+00:00,People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
7080,2017-02-05 18:05:16+00:00,Rolling out a new update today.
7081,2017-02-05 18:03:49+00:00,We should try our best
7082,2017-02-05 18:00:30+00:00,"Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."
7083,2017-02-05 17:58:40+00:00,I just had three coffees :)
7084,2017-02-05 17:58:04+00:00,Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
7085,2017-02-05 17:55:31+00:00,Numeric
7086,2017-02-05 17:53:39+00:00,Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
7087,2017-02-05 17:52:22+00:00,"I love Canada! I'm half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American, born in Minnesota."
7088,2017-02-05 17:47:42+00:00,Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
7089,2017-02-05 17:46:33+00:00,"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
7090,2017-02-05 17:40:48+00:00,True. Me being one of them :)
7091,2017-02-05 17:40:28+00:00,"Not perfect & cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
7092,2017-02-05 17:27:35+00:00,"Fair point, sorry"
7093,2017-02-05 17:26:30+00:00,"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"
7094,2017-02-05 17:20:49+00:00,Exactly
7095,2017-02-05 17:19:08+00:00,Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
7096,2017-02-05 17:18:11+00:00,Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
7097,2017-02-05 17:16:23+00:00,"Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
7098,2017-02-05 17:12:32+00:00,"Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)"
7099,2017-02-05 17:11:27+00:00,Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
7100,2017-02-05 17:09:37+00:00,"Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
7101,2017-02-05 17:02:09+00:00,Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
7102,2017-02-05 17:01:08+00:00,You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
7103,2017-02-05 16:55:20+00:00,Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
7104,2017-02-05 16:53:25+00:00,Mostly anti-drug laws
7105,2017-02-05 16:51:00+00:00,Exactly
7106,2017-02-05 16:50:19+00:00,"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
7107,2017-02-05 16:48:00+00:00,The remedy for that is changing the law
7108,2017-02-05 16:42:55+00:00,"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
7109,2017-02-05 16:42:26+00:00,There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
7110,2017-02-05 16:39:41+00:00,True!
7111,2017-02-05 16:35:21+00:00,"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."
7112,2017-02-04 23:12:36+00:00,Walking down the street and saw this
7113,2017-02-04 22:16:06+00:00,I wish!
7114,2017-02-04 22:08:52+00:00,"Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism."
7115,2017-02-04 22:02:17+00:00,"Wow, cool!"
7116,2017-02-04 22:01:38+00:00,That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
7117,2017-02-04 21:56:09+00:00,Nuances are important :)
7118,2017-02-04 19:00:25+00:00,26 ft diameter tunnel running 2 miles under D.C.
7119,2017-02-04 17:14:39+00:00,Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
7120,2017-02-04 17:07:16+00:00,"Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive."
7121,2017-02-04 17:03:52+00:00,"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong."
7122,2017-02-04 16:57:59+00:00,"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost"
7123,2017-02-04 16:39:32+00:00,First I've heard of this meeting. Will find out why.
7124,2017-02-04 12:02:18+00:00,maybe
7125,2017-02-04 11:57:38+00:00,Video of MIT's entrant into the SpaceX Hyperloop competition. Air has been removed from the Hyperloop tube to almost vacuum conditions.

7127,2017-02-04 01:38:54+00:00,"Yes. Green cards & dual citizens already ok. Work & spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon. This is separate from judicial action."
7128,2017-02-04 00:52:40+00:00,There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
7129,2017-02-03 01:39:18+00:00,Regarding the meeting at the White House:
7130,2017-02-02 19:24:41+00:00,yes
7131,2017-01-31 02:53:39+00:00,Headline & article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.
7132,2017-01-30 19:31:23+00:00,"Yes, I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity"
7133,2017-01-30 19:26:50+00:00,Top AI researchers agree on principles for developing benefical AI
7134,2017-01-30 17:50:23+00:00,"I agree with creating great jobs, restoring US strength as a great manufacturer of products and anything that makes the future exciting"
7135,2017-01-30 17:34:00+00:00,"Yeah, sorry about that :)"
7136,2017-01-30 10:52:15+00:00,"Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material"
7137,2017-01-30 05:18:59+00:00,Reading the source material is better than reading other people's opinions about the source material
7138,2017-01-29 23:11:02+00:00,Strategic & Policy Forum
7139,2017-01-29 21:34:53+00:00,"Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. It's just a non-zero possibility. Don't know more."
7140,2017-01-29 20:53:51+00:00,Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President.
7141,2017-01-29 00:42:42+00:00,It is not
7142,2017-01-29 00:35:36+00:00,"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected."
7143,2017-01-29 00:34:44+00:00,The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges
7144,2017-01-28 05:23:59+00:00,"This is silly. If adding lanes actually did make it worse, that would imply removing lanes makes it better. Obv not true."
7145,2017-01-28 04:53:54+00:00,And we start digging the tunnel tonight
7146,2017-01-27 18:32:52+00:00,Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.
7147,2017-01-27 17:43:35+00:00,"Yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people & it's getting me down. I'm just trying to make a positive contribution & hope good comes of it."
7148,2017-01-25 16:57:33+00:00,"Earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface, like waves on water. That's why LA can have a (lame, but getting better) subway."
7149,2017-01-25 09:11:56+00:00,"Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX"
7150,2017-01-25 09:09:43+00:00,Yup
7151,2017-01-25 09:08:52+00:00,Maybe next month
7152,2017-01-25 09:08:01+00:00,Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.
7153,2017-01-25 06:59:26+00:00,Rex Tillerson supports a carbon tax. This is what is really needed to move the needle.
7154,2017-01-25 06:50:18+00:00,I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.
7155,2017-01-25 06:27:15+00:00,No they don't
7156,2017-01-25 05:25:12+00:00,Was wondering what those were
7157,2017-01-25 04:37:02+00:00,Sigh
7158,2017-01-25 00:47:33+00:00,That may be a difficult award to decline
7159,2017-01-25 00:43:16+00:00,"Tillerson also said that “the risk of climate change does exist” and he believed “action should be taken"""
7160,2017-01-25 00:41:11+00:00,"... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response."""
7161,2017-01-25 00:40:30+00:00,"Tillerson at his confirmation hearing: ""I think it’s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation ..."
7162,2017-01-24 21:59:15+00:00,"Ok, fine. Soldier 76. My dark secret is out ..."
7163,2017-01-24 21:57:27+00:00,I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
7164,2017-01-24 21:51:19+00:00,"Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA."
7165,2017-01-24 21:46:24+00:00,"This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State."
7166,2017-01-24 15:29:20+00:00,There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
7167,2017-01-24 03:00:03+00:00,"3 months maybe, 6 months definitely"
7168,2017-01-23 20:44:48+00:00,"Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present"
7169,2017-01-22 18:22:55+00:00,"Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data."
7170,2017-01-22 17:02:09+00:00,Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks
7171,2017-01-22 16:57:45+00:00,For now
7172,2017-01-22 16:55:07+00:00,"The 100D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted"
7173,2017-01-22 01:55:06+00:00,Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance & ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
7174,2017-01-22 01:51:52+00:00,"If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically"
7175,2017-01-22 01:49:54+00:00,Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.
7176,2017-01-22 01:38:35+00:00,Yes
7177,2017-01-21 22:17:04+00:00,"Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way."
7178,2017-01-21 22:13:40+00:00,Giant X made of Model X's by Tesla owners in China!
7179,2017-01-21 21:57:46+00:00,Expendable. Future flights will go on Falcon Heavy or the upgraded Falcon 9.
7180,2017-01-21 21:52:58+00:00,"Car won't complete camera calibration. Working on software solution to adjust image crop dynamically, so camera more robust to pitch angle."
7181,2017-01-21 21:43:09+00:00,Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.
7182,2017-01-21 20:46:26+00:00,Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2
7183,2017-01-19 20:35:20+00:00,"Similar to SpaceX, the T is like a cross section of an electric motor, just as the X is like a rocket trajectory"
7184,2017-01-19 17:18:54+00:00,Our target is a 90% reduction with HW2 as the software matures
7185,2017-01-19 17:17:44+00:00,"Not specifically, but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by Autopilot"
7186,2017-01-19 17:15:46+00:00,It might. Am not sure.
7187,2017-01-19 17:11:35+00:00,Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.
7188,2017-01-19 17:10:24+00:00,Report highlight: “The data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation.”
7189,2017-01-19 17:09:00+00:00,Final report on Autopilot issued by @NHTSAgov is very positive https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2016/INCLA-PE16007-7876.PDF

7193,2017-01-16 10:07:07+00:00,There will be many improvements to HW1 over the course of the year
7194,2017-01-16 10:05:56+00:00,Yes
7195,2017-01-16 10:04:47+00:00,"Yeah, it has a lot of potential"

7202,2017-01-14 19:05:04+00:00,Mission looks good. Started deploying the 10 Iridium satellites. Rocket is stable on the droneship.
7203,2017-01-12 21:57:52+00:00,Have you tried steam engines? They are amazing.
7204,2017-01-12 21:56:29+00:00,Sarah should be in contact with you soon about doing a benchmark test
7205,2017-01-12 21:55:00+00:00,It is
7206,2017-01-12 21:54:15+00:00,"Hopefully, early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful."
7207,2017-01-12 21:43:16+00:00,"Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1."
7208,2017-01-12 21:41:32+00:00,It will
7209,2017-01-12 18:16:54+00:00,Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
7210,2017-01-12 18:08:12+00:00,"If the results look good from the latest point release, then we are days away from a release to all HW1 and to all HW2 early next week"
7211,2017-01-11 03:03:11+00:00,The least cool characters...it's embarrassing
7212,2017-01-11 02:52:36+00:00,It will in an upcoming release later this year
7213,2017-01-11 00:40:41+00:00,Tesla's approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. Primarily vision w radar & sonar.
7214,2017-01-10 23:57:02+00:00,Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations now has top priority. Some are overflowing while a nearby one is empty.
7215,2017-01-08 13:46:14+00:00,"Longitudinal control will, but lateral (steering) control will cap at 35 mph for a bit longer. Will raise after full fleet data rolls in."

7386,2016-10-07 17:11:37+00:00,lot of circumstantial evidence for that hypothesis
7387,2016-10-06 01:51:49+00:00,Thus I deserve to be top of the target list? Maybe there's a dude who really digs the color gold who is slightly more deserving…

7433,2016-09-21 14:29:27+00:00,My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
7434,2016-09-21 14:21:50+00:00,This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.

7543,2016-07-17 21:43:47+00:00,Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud.
7544,2016-07-17 21:16:33+00:00,Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us.
7545,2016-07-17 20:36:13+00:00,That is a very good point!

7584,2016-07-10 18:02:57+00:00,US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
7585,2016-07-10 17:55:53+00:00,Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.

7857,2016-04-02 19:24:34+00:00,"Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order."
7858,2016-04-02 19:19:36+00:00,@34thrain Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.

7899,2016-03-09 18:20:50+00:00,The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
7900,2016-03-09 16:57:53+00:00,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was 10 years away from achieving this.
7901,2016-03-06 22:47:00+00:00,"SpaceX & Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service."
7902,2016-03-06 22:40:47+00:00,"SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory."
7903,2016-03-05 18:32:48+00:00,@wk057 @TeslaMotors Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.
7904,2016-03-05 00:48:43+00:00,"Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance."
7905,2016-03-05 00:20:01+00:00,"Target altitude of 40,600 km achieved. Thanks @SES_Satellites for riding on Falcon 9! Looking forward to future missions."
7906,2016-03-04 09:32:10+00:00,@Astro_Valdric @TeslaMotors We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.

7912,2016-03-01 20:48:15+00:00,Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
7913,2016-03-01 09:46:20+00:00,@PernilleT Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
7914,2016-02-29 00:34:43+00:00,@SpaceX Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
7915,2016-02-28 23:56:33+00:00,@SpaceX AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
7916,2016-02-28 01:54:07+00:00,"@TLKFremont Great leg room for 3rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
7917,2016-02-27 21:25:10+00:00,"@derekslager @skiesforme yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
7918,2016-02-27 18:38:36+00:00,"@skiesforme Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7."
7919,2016-02-27 17:44:11+00:00,"@skiesforme @TeslaMotors That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
7920,2016-02-27 17:43:43+00:00,@skiesforme Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.

7924,2016-02-21 23:26:00+00:00,"There is no way it is only 0.5%, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as 50%."
7925,2016-02-21 23:22:39+00:00,"Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or 5% for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude"
7926,2016-02-21 01:51:20+00:00,Just wanted to thank Stu G for http://tesla.com. Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.
7927,2016-02-20 20:37:47+00:00,@nathanfielder Don't you already have a spaceship?
7928,2016-02-19 08:37:53+00:00,Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits & unpaid public health costs
7929,2016-02-19 07:31:08+00:00,Sigh …

7936,2016-02-16 21:39:08+00:00,Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
7937,2016-02-16 08:28:50+00:00,"@chriskreidler @engadget yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer"
7938,2016-02-16 08:26:18+00:00,This baby Model S really is quite fun

7943,2016-02-11 07:10:01+00:00,Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1
7944,2016-02-11 06:51:24+00:00,@ErikRoesegg good point
7945,2016-02-10 08:49:55+00:00,Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
7946,2016-02-10 08:07:55+00:00,Love this Tesla video made by

7948,2016-02-03 08:41:47+00:00,Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
7949,2016-01-23 19:43:17+00:00,@TheEconomist Interesting name
7950,2016-01-20 17:56:05+00:00,@Benzinga I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
7951,2016-01-19 04:11:54+00:00,"My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017"
7952,2016-01-18 03:09:21+00:00,@JeffBezos @SpaceX Thanks Jeff

7954,2016-01-17 22:14:51+00:00,"@stunt_penguin @LayOn_OverWhale Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced."
7955,2016-01-17 22:13:12+00:00,"@JimmyVosika Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed."
7956,2016-01-17 22:09:45+00:00,"If speed at stage separation > ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
7957,2016-01-17 22:03:47+00:00,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
7958,2016-01-17 21:56:49+00:00,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude & distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."

7960,2016-01-17 21:38:01+00:00,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
7961,2016-01-17 20:14:59+00:00,@Uncle_Gus probably
7962,2016-01-17 20:13:58+00:00,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
7963,2016-01-17 20:06:21+00:00,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating & rotating."
7964,2016-01-16 01:47:15+00:00,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
7965,2016-01-16 01:38:49+00:00,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations."
7966,2016-01-12 18:21:28+00:00,Next launch is a @NASA science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.
7967,2016-01-12 02:57:10+00:00,Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions

8013,2015-11-24 12:30:59+00:00,"Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit."
