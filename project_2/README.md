# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge


## The Problem Statement

Predicting the housing prices of Ames location

## The Modeling Process

I have denerated a regression model using the training data,implementing the following
    - train-test split
    - cross-validation
    - exploratory data analysis to question correlation and relationship across predictive variables code that 
    reproducibly and consistently applies feature transformation was conducted.
    I predicted the values for the target saleprice column in the test dataset and submited predictions to 
    Kaggle to see how your model does against unknown data.
   
I have implemented the following:
    - consider your evaluation metrics
    - consider your baseline score
    - how can your model be used for inference?
    - why do you believe your model will generalize to new data?

## Modeling Evaluation
 
It was inconclusive as to which model was best after running the train_test_split


## Business Recommendations
I would recommend to target housing developments that can
